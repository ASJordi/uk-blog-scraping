Blood moves slower through a larger space, and this is detected by a receptor called the sinoatrial node (SAN). SAN sends signal to the brain to say that blood pressure is lower in the heart which in turn sends signals back causing the heart rate to speed up. The opposite is true when we exhale- the diaphragm moves up, leading to less volume, pressure increases, and the brain sends signals to slow the heart rate down. When we are stressed some of the 500 million balloon like air sacs in the lungs become collapsed due to increased breathing rate and shallow inhales. This limits gas exchange and increases the CO2 levels in the blood. This contributes to that agitated feeling. ",

It is clear over the course of the VARSS reports since the first one was published in 2014 (presenting data from 2013), that data on antibiotic sales and use are powerful tools for understanding trends and patterns of antibiotic prescribing and on-farm use at every level.

We\u2019re no longer seeing the big reductions of four or five years ago, but those reductions have been held, and sector targets for further improvements in stewardship are in place. The UK has seen overall decreasing trends of AMR in internationally recognised indicator bacteria (E. coli) since 2014, including declines in multi-drug resistance and resistance to HP-CIAs. As the agriculture sectors continue their work towards the new targets set last year by the Targets Task Force, we hope to see further correlation between the efforts made towards reduction and responsible use of antibiotics in food producing animals and the levels of AMR found through our ongoing surveillance programmes.",

It also involves a much, much larger number of vets \u2013 vets who treat companion animals make up a sizeable majority of the approximately 27,000 registered practising vets in the UK. Joined up communication and coordinated action is a significant challenge. With this in mind, and on the back of their success in the agriculture sectors, the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance (RUMA) have convened a companion animal and equine group to explore target setting for reduction in antibiotic use across these sectors, and to assess the different challenges in these animal groups. At present, the group is exploring ways to measure antibiotic use at practice level and identifying specific areas of importance, such as the use of antibiotics most critical for human health. This work is in the early stages, but there is scope for this group to provide similar momentum across these sectors as has been achieved by the Targets Task Force for the livestock sectors. RCVS Knowledge has also just launched an initiative under its VetTeamAMR project, helping small animal and equine vet practices audit their antibiotic use and support them to put measures in place to improve and monitor their prescribing behaviours.",

This subgroup was formed to develop a strategy for the integration of AMR surveillance across the different sectors (animals, humans, food, and the environment), and the four UK nations.
