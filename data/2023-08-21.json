When his country capitulated to Nazi Germany in 1940, Mouchotte didn't: he escaped with five others in a stolen aircraft, flying just above the wavetops to Gibraltar. From there, he\nmade his way to England and RAF Fighter Command. In 1941, he flew operational missions defending the United Kingdom during the Blitz. While in command of 65 Squadron, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on September 1, 1942.",
