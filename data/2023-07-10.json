Evidence from the British Trust for Ornithology and others tells us that lack of light and structure in woodlands has been a key factor in loss of woodland species, such as lesser spotted woodpecker, willow tit, purple emperor or white admiral butterflies, whose complex lifecycles depend on just the right combination of scrub, flowers and mature trees.",

Despite the preoccupation with fighting a world war, the government prioritised planning for this. In June 1941, Labour minister Arthur Greenwood announced to the House of Commons that a new committee had been formed to survey existing social security provision and allied services under the chairmanship of Sir William Beveridge.[2] This became the totemic 1942 Beveridge Report, which identified \u2018Five Giants\u2019 that needed to be tackled in order for Britain to succeed economically and socially. The five giants were Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. Influential economist and civil servant John Maynard Keynes was also consulted by Beveridge during the making of the report. At his suggestion Beveridge modified some recommendations, thus Keynes believed the plan to be broadly affordable.[3]",

The recommendations of the Beveridge Report widened the scope set by Lloyd George\u2019s National Insurance Act (1911). Beveridge offered a blueprint for a comprehensive welfare state. In the years after publication, the coalition government worked on plans for turning the recommendations into reality, including producing a White Paper. Full implementation was however not guaranteed. In March 1943, Churchill warned against imposing significant new expenditures without knowing the full post war economic picture; yet he also advocated a \u2018national compulsory insurance for all classes for all purposes from the cradle to the grave.\u2019[6]",
