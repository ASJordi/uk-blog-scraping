The last such expansion, and the only one in my lifetime to date, was 31 years ago in October 1991. Little did I know then that I would be heavily involved in the next update to the SI prefixes. The change in 1991 increased the range to cover between 1024 (yotta, Y) and 10-24 (yocto, y), principally to meet the needs of chemistry to express molecular quantities in SI units. Those 31 years that have passed since then represent the longest gap between extensions to the range of prefixes since they were first adopted by the Metre Convention in 1879, four years after the treaty was signed. Back then only the range from 1000 to 1/1000 was covered: kilo to milli.",
