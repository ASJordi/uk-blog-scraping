As you can imagine, this interconnects with the work of all other teams in the FSA, some other government departments, and also external stakeholders such as enforcement bodies, researchers and the food industry. Most importantly, any reforms that we make to policy must continue to protect consumers of food.

Although I did not have previous tech experience, I have never felt disadvantaged. I feel well supported by my team and I am amazed at the wide range of learning and development opportunities offered within DDaT. Recently, I have been fortunate enough to deliver some great product adoption campaigns promoting the use of tech products created by DDaT.
