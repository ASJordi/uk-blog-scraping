After storms in 2014, the police reported the discovery of human bones on Rat Island and so as DIO\u2019s Senior Archaeologist, I had the site send me the bones. I was half expecting them to be animal bones, but I was greeted with, amongst other elements, a very clearly human skull in an evidence bag.

The bodies were in elm coffins and aligned east -west in a standard Christian fashion even though this is not consecrated land.

And this is one year worth of data with discrete incremental changes that will transpire through it. The next one would be probably data smoothing and cleaning. And this is a pretty big one for me, especially if we talk about data modelling, the majority of the systems we try to model will be nonlinear. And while I understand that linearity is intuitive and drives actionable results, I'm careful with it especially when the data relates to people and complicated business processes, because life is most likely not linear. The last one is consider if the data sample is representative. This is especially pertinent for interpreting results and the purpose of your data investigation. Context matters. There are 2 main aspects to consider - the evident technical aspects, so is it really statistically representative? But also the ethical considerations.

As Olga mentioned earlier, the way that we previously worked with data was to try and collect data and store it centrally. But this ended up with trying to make the data warehouses a bit of a jack of all trades. It also left other teams with small islands of siloed data that can't be shared with each other. It's difficult to manage when technology changes so quickly and we're building so many products all the time.",

To do this, we need to be able to embrace the latest technologies and improve how we connect data together. The data mesh concept allows us to start to decentralise the ownership of data. So responsibility for the data will lie with the product teams who create the products, enabling them to use the technology that they choose. At the same time, the central teams who currently run the data stores will still provide some structure and building blocks that allow products to create data that is able to be shared and used in the right way across other products in DWP. So we could use data from Universal Credit, for example, to help us to reduce the number of questions a citizen had to answer in a health application.",

With the data mesh, we will be able to access and govern data via connections that are standardised. This will allow us to use the different datasets and combine them to show a huge range of use cases beyond what we can at the moment. For both operational data that we need to process claims and for data that we use for analysis, it will open a wealth of opportunity for innovation and change the way that we work at DWP, ultimately making things better for the citizens that have to use our products.",
