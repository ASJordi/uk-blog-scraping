From experience it is key you are clear about how people can contact you, get involved and keep a friendly tone to your social media and communications so people want to volunteer. We have found that volunteers are wary of taking on too much and often like to get involved in one or two events each year so we have recruited volunteers to events, rather than the entire PTA. For example, we have a Cake Sale team, Preloved Uniform team and a Christmas Card team with specific people who look after those events. We also have PTA Champions; these people are our go-to people in each year group for all PTA queries. It helps having someone in your year group who you can bump into on the playground to answer questions and dispel myths.

I work in a small of team of highly experienced scientists with specialisation in physics and engineering. The projects are usually interdisciplinary in nature and this makes the engineering aspects of the work even more interesting. Daily tasks include designing experiments, developing instrumentation, studying new sources of EMF and analysing complex measurement data. These complex yet rewarding problem-solving activities usually lead to research publications, which are used, in turn, to develop PHE\u2019s advice and guidance on EMF health effects. Apart from core scientific work usually limited to my group, I was interested in the different research activities of the Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE) \u00a0and therefore, with the support my colleagues, I co-founded the \u2018Science Converge\u2019 forum for civil servant scientists, engineers and early career professionals. The inspiration to start the forum came from one of the Government Science and Engineering and Scientific (GSE) Careers workshop event held at CRCE, highlighting the benefits of increasing interactions among our scientists.",

The dermis layer alone is highly complicated, it can be thought of as an intelligent sensor with lots of intricate features that provides, in some cases, visual cues for human health. With this idea as a motivation, my PhD work concluded in leveraging our understanding on \u201cin-vivo communication\u201d for network of nanodevices working in the Terahertz range when restricted to the dermis layer of the skin.",

By chance again, managed to build a good relationship with some folks in a local city, sorry. And became a creative director in that business before kind of continuing on. Worked for a local development agency called Code Works in the northeast of England, which does fantastic work with all of the different agencies and businesses in terms of design development in the north east, which is great. Set up a conference called Design and Build it, which was for web designers and developers. And then I continued after leaving there to set up my own web design conference, which was called Industry for four years, and worked at various different agencies in New York doing mobile app design, again in South Africa, before joining the travel company as head of user experience, and then latterly head of user experience and product, before joining the Department for Work and Pensions in 2015.",

So if you joined DWP Digital, you would likely have a very singular focus around one benefit line. I think our shift for our department and Share Channels Experience has been to create something that's completely unique, and which looks across the end to end experience. So we were set up in April 2020. And this was all around a drive to accept that we weren't really delivering a really focused service.

So, I've not heard of any other government department doing this sort of work or this set up.

So for instance, that could be maybe the way that we do payments, for instance, or the way that we look at residency information or relationships.

So that we can join more dots up, but not just kind of on paper if that makes sense. We don't want to just draw a diagram for it to be put into a drawing for, you know, an inordinate amount of time.

We also realised that there was a very big pattern, and it's about 33% of our current user base of people who need help with more than one benefit. So a lot of the research that we did, very recently has been with people who are in receipt of multiple benefits. And some of the really insightful things that we heard during user research was around people who perhaps were in receipt of Universal Credit, and then had an accident, for example, and then suddenly they needed a health benefit and some support. And I think for me, listening to some of the feedback from our users have some really powerful things that came out of that conversation around you know, when your life becomes suddenly thrown into chaos or something, you know, radical\u2019s happened. And one that stands out for me is somebody who was in a very severe car accident and lost use of his legs. So for him, his world had completely changed overnight and everything he needed from us as a department had changed. His priority wasn't to look for work anymore.

And we're starting to look at the types of datasets that they need, what the interface could look like for them. And we're also starting to think about it from a customer point of view as well around at the moment, they have to call us up to get access to information. So, what could we do as a digital service to help them access information, their information, it could be copies of letters, it could be an email that we've sent, or it could be that they've got a query about, when am I going to get paid next? Or why is my payment a little bit late? So we're just looking at playing around with different ways that we could do that and how we could improve the experience. And I think, you know, for me, that's been one of the key things for our team has been, we don't have a cookie cutter approach. Because this is very new ways of working, we don't have anybody we can copy off, really.

But also try and be not the only group working on it but understanding where the work is being led from, which inherently is communication. And it's you know, myself and a friend of mine always say communication, communication, communication, because unless we have that clear communication with the clarity and the simpleness of just communicating things to other folks to understand their place in the world, we\u2019ll often create duplication will often create breakdowns in communication, we\u2019ll often create the silos unfortunately, that, you know, exist purely because of the lack of communication.",

You know, the work that we're doing, how that helps you. And obviously, that does come with a lot of questions and folks wanting to talk to you. But having a single place to communicate everything is really, really helpful. Now that could be things like Confluence spaces, it could be in show and tells which we do regularly anyway. But I think it's the most important, it\u2019s just what are you trying to communicate? How are you going to communicate it so that everybody can stay on board and their level of communication, because certain different stakeholder groups, for instance, will want a different level of communication.

And I think even some of the one to ones that Fay and I have it's a case of are we both ok? Are we overwhelmed? Is there too much? And we've got to kind of look back on it, too, you know, how do you build a 12 foot wall? You've got to do brick by brick, you can't just pick up a wall in all one go.",

And this especially kind of the direction and the strategic point of view, it's one thing, you know, just trying to aim for that kind of North Star. But in any strategy, something will come at you from a direction that you're least expecting it. And it's how we take stock of that information about what has happened. And then if we need to change direction and come at it from a different way, then that's what we have to do. So, I think it's just remembering that the work that we're doing is grand, it is great.

And we always talk about that, don't we, in terms of technology is just one part. The bigger challenge always is the culture shift. So one of the kinds of challenges I would call out for us has definitely been around the sheer scale, as Gavin touched on, it's all needs for all users, that we get a lot of interest in our work. So sometimes, you know, we get crowded by what our boss Cheryl calls enthusiastic amateurs. So, lots of people really well intentioned want to get involved. And you know, they've not done this work before. So lots of people have an opinion on what the right thing to do is for our users. Lots of people come to our show and tells so we get around 120, I would say, on average, and people dialling in each fortnight to pretty much all of the themes of work that we cover from customer experience to colleague experience, and some of the work we're doing around tooling as well.",

Do really know enough about what you're doing? And so part of our response to that has been all around, you know, the experimentations, I touched on before to really show well, look, we don't know what the right answer is, because you know, we've not done this before. But we're just going to test and we're going to learn and we're going to share the outcomes of that. And that will help guide us to a healthy place.

So, you know, why would people use an account? What would they get from that? So we're trying all the time to think about, you know, apps, different types of ways that customers interact with us.

User experience was the thing that was used prior to that, even though there was services being done on a on a sub level, kind of hidden out of the way of user experience\u2019s view.

So I think our approach now is equal to our maturity, which is either more mature or less than other organisations like us in terms of size and scale. There aren't many organisations equal to our size, in the way that we operate and our offering. If not, there may not be there may just be in other kind of governments in other parts of the world, for instance. So I think whilst we may still have a lot of maturing to do, but that's totally normal. And no organisation can stay at the same maturity level, through its lifespan, if that makes sense.

But it's also the most important like I\u2019ve mentioned. It'll be the biggest challenge. Larger organisations aren't created over days, generally, they've been around for 10, or 100 years or more.

In terms of the setup, I think it's a matter of determining what things should be and can be shared across the organisation, and putting in the right levels of experience in those things, making sure that all of the professions that should work together do work together, for instance. And the pro things of all of this should make the customer user experience better. As well as increasing the reusability within your organisation and doing the legs of reducing spend, creating efficiencies than you've probably ever had. But it does need to be carefully managed, because you've got to measure things in the right way. And hopefully, you do set up those measurements in advance. Because if you don't start in advance, you don't really know what you're measuring at the end. So the top tips, I think, from me, I mentioned one of them a little bit earlier on. So empowerment and strategy. If you have the strategy and make sure the people involved have the empowerment towards that, and the accountability, because that's important, too, to get the things that need doing done, do that.

This is exactly what we're going to find out and exactly what we're going to create in the future. Instead, we just said, well, let's start at the very beginning. So we asked ourselves lots of fundamental questions like, where is the customer experience today? What do we know about that? What can we prove about that? And we really started to gather data.

And I'll always answer them honestly to say, well, we just don't know yet. So I think having a level of ambiguity but showing people how we're going to get to where the answer is. So being clear about what's the strategy to get to the strategy has been important. And I think, you know, making sure that you have the right team around you who understand that we're at the very start of the big journey, and that there are some fundamental things we have to get right before we can just start to build services.
