An important part of our role is education, and we talk to retailers about non-native species legislation and their responsibilities.

Plastic has a lower buoyancy than seawater so will float, and when pushed by wind and waves it can travel hundreds and even thousands of miles before being washed up. If animals or plants that normally settle on rocks attach to the plastic and survive the transport they can be washed up with the litter in areas where they didn\u2019t previously occur. Biogeographic barriers such as distance, depth, salinity and temperature usually prevent the long-distance movement of species, but increasingly, human activity is providing species a way around these barriers.",

With millions of tonnes of plastic entering the sea every year, this is becoming an urgent problem. Cefas is expanding the monitoring of marine debris for non-native species (some of which will become invasive species) to better understand this modern phenomenon.",

Very popular among North American fishermen, the intention is that bait is placed inside, the lid is screwed on, but the holes let the smell of the bait escape, which attracts fish, lobsters etc. The problem is that when the pots break loose, the enclosed containers provide an ideal home for anything that can squeeze through the slits, including larvae and juvenile animals. Once inside, the pot creates a perfect microcosm for animals that can feed on microscopic particles as sea water flows through it, but then they grow too big to escape. The pots also offer protection, increasing the chance that enclosed animals will survive until they wash up on a beach.",

Among those that we know attach to anything floating in the open ocean - goose barnacles and keel worms, which are more often found on boat hulls - were some rarer finds such as the isopod Idotea metallica (similar to a sea-living woodlouse) which is known to be transported on floating logs or clumps of seaweed but is increasingly being found on floating chunks of plastic. In amongst these were tiny shellfish, the limpet Eoacmaea pustulata and the scallop Aequipecten heliacus (Figure 3) which occur in the Gulf of Mexico. We could only identify these exotics by consulting our literature on tropical shells, but we had a clue since these species had recently been found in Britain, again washed up on plastic debris. Still, it was surprising to see these animals alive when they washed up on Chesil Beach.",
