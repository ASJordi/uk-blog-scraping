This was a significant moment in terms of the committee preventing harm from existing screening activity and it set the scene for the committee to continue making important recommendations NOT to screen for conditions which were not warranted by the evidence. But the committee realised that, in the absence of screening, men needed help to make decisions about PSA testing and established the prostate cancer risk management programme.",
