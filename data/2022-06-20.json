However, the Spanish red kites released in England have thrived to the extent that the Rare Breeding Bird Panel no longer monitors them because there are now more than 2,000 pairs and rising.

In my home county of Cornwall, we now look forward each year to immature red kites passing over on their spring break, with several hundred a day in the skies as they are funnelled down over ever narrowing land towards Lands End. New wildlife spectacles are something special and point to hope for nature recovery through concerted international partnership effort.

Many did not understand what distinguished sharing their data through these schemes from other methods of sharing personal data. As a result, public attitudes towards Smart Data tended to be an extension of attitudes towards data sharing more generally. Participants were concerned about the conduct of TPPs, potential further loss of control over data about them, and the potential for businesses to profit off data about them.
