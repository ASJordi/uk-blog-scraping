Influenza is constantly changing and mutating, meaning it can easily evade the immune system. We have been working on influenza for many decades and as an Essential Regulatory Laboratory (ERL) we collaborate with the WHO and the other three ERLs to prepare for every influenza season. This starts with reviewing data collected over the previous winter months to identify which flu strains have been most prevalent. An expert panel, including a representative from MHRA, then meets in February to select which strains are most appropriate for the development of vaccines for the upcoming northern hemisphere season (the same process happens in September for the southern hemisphere influenza season). The latest recommendations from this most recent meeting have just been announced.",

The MHRA is essential to ensuring this deadline is met by developing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). These CVVs are viruses that match the selected influenza strains each year but grow much better, enabling manufacturers worldwide to develop the required amount of vaccine in the time available. Once produced, we need to confirm that the vaccine works and that it meets specifications using a vaccine potency test developed by our experts (in what was then known as NIBSC) in the 1970s, which is still the gold standard today. This potency test requires the use of two types of reagents, an antigen standard and an antiserum. These reagents are produced by the MHRA and the other ERLs and distributed to vaccine manufacturers and independent control laboratories worldwide. Once all the processes have been completed, the influenza vaccine is ready to be delivered.",

Many species landed in markets in Sri Lanka are listed under Appendix II of CITES which means trade is allowed but should be regulated. Regulation of this trade is based on a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) which is an assessment showing that trade is only allowed at sustainable levels. Data on what sharks and rays are being caught and landed is currently limited, but improving this will support better NDFs and potentially, enable stock assessments to inform appropriate (sustainable) catch and trade levels.\u00a0 Throughout the world there is a significant market for elasmobranch products. Sharks and rays are traded for their fins for use in traditional Asian cuisine, mobulid rays are caught for their gill plates to supply the Chinese medicine market, and other species of rays for their skin which is used for leather-like products. For this reason, elasmobranchs are often processed at landing sites and markets with fins and other body parts detached. Therefore, not only do sharks and rays need to be identified correctly, they may also need to be identified correctly from their constituent body parts at the point of trade.",

Throughout the workshop, the trainers stressed the need for species-specific data. Currently, the Sri Lankan authorities collect a large amount of aggregated species data due to the high numbers of elasmobranch species landed at markets and the lack of experience in species identification. This makes it harder to monitor trends in and estimate the total removals from elasmobranch populations.

We can see an example of solutions to reducing extreme demands on the water cycle and impacts on nature in our approach to mitigating impacts of nutrients resulting from built development. The Nutrient Mitigation Scheme - launched on 31 March (read more on our blog here) - sees us working with local landowners, local planning authorities and Habitat Delivery Partners to identify opportunities to create habitats (e.g. wetlands) to offset nutrient pollution. These then create credits that developers can purchase, providing assurance to Local planning Authorities and developers that additional nutrients from proposed developments will be mitigated for. This will enable the building of new homes in a way that benefits the natural environment. As explained in the Plan for Water, serious long-term reductions in agricultural pollution are needed to complete the system-wide improvement and allow nature to recover in our most important wetlands.",
