This highlights the need for departments properly to comply with the statutory requirement for PIRs to inform decisions over whether regulations should be repealed, retained, amended or replaced.

They were impressed with the UK Office for Statistical Regulation in championing how statistics are produced, used and valued, and the need for independent official statistics in uncertain times. New Zealand does not have the same level of assurance, with Statistics New Zealand producing most of the official statistics, but other agencies produce many of what they refer to as \u2018Tier 1\u2019 statistics.\u00a0 In the UK, there is a regulatory approach to enforcing the quality standards required to maintain independent statistics and UK Ministers are required to sign a code of practice about the appropriate use of statistics.\u00a0 On social licence, they were also impressed by their engagement with the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, who are using deliberative polling methodologies \u2013 giving people scenarios where their information is used in different ways and assessing their level of comfort with that use.",
