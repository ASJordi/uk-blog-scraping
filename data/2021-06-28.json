We plan to restart these inspections shortly, but before we do, we have taken the opportunity to review our guidance. Through regular meetings with the Organisation for Childminder Agencies (OFCMA) and representatives of the 11 agencies currently registered with us, we looked at where we could improve how we work. These discussions focused on some changes to the way we register and inspect agencies and in June this year, we republished some of our guidance documents and application forms with some updates.",
