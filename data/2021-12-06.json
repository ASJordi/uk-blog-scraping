That means we assess all public or NHS facing services, commissioned by DHSC or any of its partner organisations, that have under 100,000 transactions per year.\u00a0",

                "content": "A charity has defied the Covid slump to award a record \u00a33.3million in grants to British veterans in need, according to its latest annual figures. The Veterans\u2019 Foundation (VF), a registered charity based in Edinburgh, helped more than 130 military charities and organisations in the year to June 2021. The VF provides funds to charities and other organisations that support serving and former members of the British Armed Forces, operationally qualified seafarers and their dependants. It acquires its funds through the Veterans\u2019 Lottery and donations and primarily supports low and medium-wealth charities that need funds to continue their good work. The \u00a33.3million sum represents a year-on-year increase of more than 70%. Since its inception in 2016 the VF has given \u00a37.1million in grants to more than 240 military charities and organisations, including Scotty\u2019s Little Soldiers, Service Dogs UK, Walking With The Wounded, Rock 2 Recovery and Veterans Into Logistics. Most of the VF's income comes from the Veterans' Lottery, which had 64,000 players at the end of the financial year, up by more than 40% on the previous year. The top prize is \u00a335,000. \u2018This represents an exceptional performance during a period in which most charities saw a drop in their fundraising income and one which made the grant-making of the Veterans' Foundation even more important,\u2019 said chairman Peter Mountford. The Veterans' Foundation has had a significant incremental impact on the support given to servicepeople and their families, not just in the year, but cumulatively over the last five years,' he added. Health and wellbeing, particularly mental health support, have been important areas of attention for the VF over the 12 months and more than \u00a31.2million has gone to help our ex-service personnel get healthier. A fifth of the year's awards have also directly assisted veterans with educational and unemployment issues, helping them to learn new skills and find a new career. Charities helping veterans to address homelessness, family welfare and wellbeing, and community hubs that provide signposting and advice, have also received financial support. 'The Veterans' Foundation not only grew its income year-on-year during the pandemic period, but it has been able to provide funding to more organisations helping members of the Armed Forces who are in need,' said Major General David Shaw, CEO and founder. 'The growth is a reflection of public support, the hard work of our creative teams that reach members of the public and the work of the trustees and staff of the Veterans' Foundation. 'More importantly, we know the beneficiaries have had their lives improved through the funds raised, but it doesn't stop there - with continuing support we will work hard to achieve more.' ",

It has been harnessed to combat the pandemic; from supporting the discovery of new therapies and rapid virus detection methods, to powering dashboards that help clinicians make treatment decisions on the frontline. In 2020, DeepMind\u2019s AI system AlphaFold made a huge leap forward in solving one of biology's greatest challenges, the protein folding problem, which could vastly accelerate efforts to understand the building blocks of cells, in turn improving and speeding up drug discovery. AI presents game changing opportunities in other sectors, too, such as the potential for operating an efficient and resilient green energy grid.

These risks often go beyond the challenges posed by regular software because of AI\u2019s autonomous, complex and scalable nature. There have been several examples of these risks materialising in the past decade, as organisations have begun to develop and deploy AI systems. Risks can relate, for example, to bias and fairness. For instance, AI recruitment tools have been found to favour men due to biases in the data they were trained on. They can also relate to accuracy. For example, AI systems used in healthcare have given unsafe and incorrect treatment recommendations. Risks can also arise that are to do with robustness. Autonomous vehicles' computer vision systems have been found, for example, to struggle with a variety of sub-optimal conditions on the road, such as low light and partially obscured road signs, which can cause accidents. Challenges such as these make organisations more uncertain about adopting AI, and people more wary of trusting automated decisions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

For instance, it will enable developers of AI systems to assure others in the supply chain, such as an organisation procuring AI, that the AI systems they have built are trustworthy and legally compliant. Meanwhile, it will enable those deploying AI to communicate this information to those affected by AI systems, such as a job applicant whose CV is sifted using an AI tool.

I was able to take the day off with my line manager\u2019s approval and volunteered from 8:30am \u2013 5:30pm in the lovely Westminster sunshine. I was a steward for the day, making sure people were in the right place to receive their vaccine. The whole experience was very rewarding, I got to meet so many people and discuss what getting the vaccine meant to them. I would highly recommend volunteering for a cause you care about and using your volunteering days.\u201d Millie Martin, Engagement and Strategic Adoption team",

The conservation work involved a day of litter picking and raking mown areas to encourage meadow development. I would recommend it to anybody wanting to do a volunteer day outdoors. It's a complete change to working in an office (or at home). You're also helping to maintain an outdoor area which is used by many people for walking, cycling, and sports. It was great to get outdoors and the work itself was better than a gym workout!\u201d Julie Fenn, Live Services team",
