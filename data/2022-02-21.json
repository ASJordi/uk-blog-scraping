We\u2019ve been really working closely with farmers and land managers to see how we can improve the scheme since we took it on in 2018 and it\u2019s been really good to see, certainly last year, the increase in the uptake of applications that we received for the scheme.",

Another popular scheme we ran was the Countryside Productivity Small Grants Scheme which provides investment towards specific items of equipment focused on improving productivity and efficiency for farmers and horticultural businesses which is a really important element as and when we move across to the agricultural transition period. We released around \u00a316m of payments on around 2,800 eligible claims.",

We launched the Farming Investment Fund, including the Farming Equipment and Technology Fund and the Water Management theme of the Farming Transformation Fund. I can\u2019t stress the importance of productivity and how we as Government can support farmers to improve their productivity in these challenging times. It was really fantastic to see farmers will benefit from investment to boost that productivity through a whole range of equipment that we\u2019ve made available. We also opened up the sixth round of the popular Countryside Stewardship Facilitation Fund in December. There is nothing more important for us than farmers working together in a collaborative way, sharing their knowledge in their communities to protect and enhance their local environment, and that\u2019s in line with their local Countryside Stewardship priorities. But it\u2019s not all about the land. We recognise, in particular at the end of the year, the challenges that the pig industry were facing. We announced a package of measures to support the pig industry, which focused on reducing the animal welfare implications of pigs backing up on farms. This saw the launch of the Slaughter Incentive Payment Scheme which focused on increasing the throughput of pigs by contributing towards the extra costs of operating additional slaughter shifts at abattoirs, but that was just one element of it. We also opened up a Private Storage Aid scheme which provided some funding to cover the costs of cold storage for the products.",

A lot of the focus tends to be on the land schemes that we pay out in December. To give some context on our land schemes, in December we paid just under 101,300 claims, which is essentially investing \u00a31.8bn into the farming community, and that\u2019s within the first month of the payment window which runs between December and June. That investment isn\u2019t just a direct investment, we\u2019ve seen at first hand how that payment then trickles down throughout the supply chain. To set it into context, that represents just over 98% of eligible claims for the Basic Payment Scheme, around 62% of Countryside Stewardship revenue claims and around 64% of Environmental Stewardship claims for 2021.",

That\u2019s around 5,700 projects and since we took on the scheme in 2018 we\u2019ve reduced the amount of time where we\u2019ve paid those particular claims and it was really pleasing to see that most of them were paid within an average of 30 working days.",

For example, the allocation of common land can be quite a complex process. What we do with common land is we allocate the available area to those claiming on the common. Sometimes the outcome of inspections can take a little time for us to consider and establish the impact on the claim or agreement. In some cases, we can\u2019t progress claims as they are reliant on the completion of legal work, such as probate, and some just take time because of their size.",

As I mentioned earlier, we are constantly looking to learn, listen and do better and in 2021, a good example of that listening is we attended a record number of shows and events across the country. That two-way engagement with our farmers is incredibly important and I\u2019ll give you a good example. We did an MP roundtable in Cumbria at the beginning of November, and we had a new member of staff that had just joined. It was literally his fourth week within the business and it was really great to hear from him last week and he said, \u201cSandy, I was so pleased to be able to come along to an event like that and hear farmers talk about their experiences, and what that\u2019s meant for me in particular, now that I\u2019m working on something, I realise there is a farmer at the end of the work that I do.\u201d I think that\u2019s incredibly important, so that level of connection that we need to build with farming communities focused on our need to build different relationships with farmers will be incredibly important. 2022 and beyond is going to be a really challenging time for farmers and our role as the RPA is to help farmers through this transition period and provide them with the best information to help them secure their future. We have great people in the RPA who are really, genuinely committed to what they do, most of them live in the areas they serve, many of them have farming in their background \u2013 they\u2019re either married to farmers, their children are farming - and that passion is really great to see across all of the services that we operate. So, we\u2019re all geared up and focused on delivering better outcomes for farmers but working in partnership with farmers across 2022.",

After all, the department had been responsible for considerable nationwide delivery for years (for example, in regeneration funding) and there was an opportunity to improve the quality of that work by using a service perspective to better connect policy work with the real-world user impact of these decisions - a shift in thinking that has been emerging from digital and policy teams across government through groups like Policy Lab and OneTeamGovernment. There was also an opportunity to use service thinking to identify reusable components or approaches that lay horizontally across a department that remain primarily organised by policy areas.",

Those departments understand that the government is providing a service every time it offers people a way to do something, like get a driving licence, qualify in a profession or access an entitlement. Services need to stay \u2018switched on\u2019 and they must work well during their lifetime, so that people can get what they need, when they need it. There is a cost to providing every service, even if it\u2019s just a little bit of staff time, which should be weighed against the service\u2019s benefit to the public. We knew that we could make better resourcing and prioritisation decisions in DLUHC, if we could identify which \u201cpieces of work\u201d were services that needed to be treated in this way.",
