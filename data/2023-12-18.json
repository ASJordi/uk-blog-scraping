Bank A has a relationship with Bank B who has a presence in both the UK and Brazil. Bank A will transfer the funds to Bank B in the UK who will transfer the funds from its UK entity to its Brazil entity. The funds will then be transferred from the Brazil entity of Bank B to their final destination at Bank X. To enable this, the banks have accounts with each other (these are known as \u201cnostro\u201d and \u201cvostro\u201d accounts).

It was great to meet with colleagues from across the MoJ and discuss developments in AI and how they might impact our work.

There has been much written about the biases in artificial intelligence training data sets and how human intervention and collaboration is needed. We were given great examples of AI working well including satellitte images to estimate populations and transec tracking and alleviating urban congestion.
