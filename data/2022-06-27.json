The aim is for central government to shape and where necessary regulate a modern digital marketplace, not for central government to supply or centralise an area of public service that thrives on proximity and trust with local communities.

But these existing systems mostly transport analogue data, largely in the form of uploaded PDF documents which have to be matched against a set of rules that again only exist as (hard to find) documents, and it is often not straightforward to extract the data and use it in an interoperable way. The planning system prizes the space given for judgement calls about the suitability of development by planning professionals and politicians, but large parts of the system, especially where national permitted development policy is concerned, is essentially rules-based \u2013 if it meets the criteria set out then it's fine to proceed past that element of the process.
