Seeing how things operate in practice is really important to the successful running of Life Chances schemes, as we have to understand who we are trying to reach through our different methods of recruitment, and what barriers they might face.\u00a0Speaking to Prison Service colleagues on a recent visit to a Young Offender Institution, I was shocked to hear that nearly a quarter of the young men being held in custody there had come from care-experienced backgrounds. The prison had been working to adopt an approach based around Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES), and training staff to understand the impact these experiences may have on the people in their care. A significant number of the young men had experienced violence and trauma growing up, and continued to be affected by influences as they grew up such as the gang culture that was prevalent in that area. I was struck by how easy it is to forget that these types of backgrounds and barriers exist, particularly when I have the privilege of a supportive family and friends, and how difficult it must be to get onto the right track when your start to adult life is affected by what has gone before.\u00a0 But it also brought home to me how important our collective work is - 'The first step is in recognising that not everyone has the same opportunities, and the life chances that we create might be the turning point to a better future'.",

The wildlife has thrived alongside these activities, and in many cases, it is these activities that have supported the wildlife by creating the different mosaics of habitats required by different species. Examples of this include sailing clubs regularly pollarding trees and angling clubs maintaining scrub around their angling lakes. Many owners actively manage the lakes and surrounding habitat for the benefit of wildlife, and some lakes are specifically kept for conservation. All of this has contributed to the wildlife we see today, with birds being able to move to different lakes at different times, and therefore are able to thrive alongside recreation.\u00a0",

To be able to just try stuff and think about things, work on your own or as part of a team to just solutionize, if you like.

And with that, as Dave mentioned, you've got the issues around the high availability and things like that. Previously, it was just running on a single server.

Now they\u2019re there, the traffic will get sent to one of two virtual IP addresses. So each of the cluster pairs in each data centre has a virtual IP address, which indicates that is the master.

Unfortunately to actually go through all those governance and rules and regulations, I think it was about five months.

And one of them is within our hybrid cloud services. So that team are looking to deploy NGINX as well. So we are the ones that they're coming to, \u201cWhat have you delivered first?\u201d And so keeping that close relationship with this other team is kind of key because DWP has got a target to go cloud first, so looking at getting everything as much in the cloud as we can.",

So, one of the things is we're looking to deploy, and we're actually at the commercial stage of this, is to bring in another part of NGINX, which is the instance manager. So with the instance manager, it will enable us to be able to manage our cluster service a lot easier. It will also help us to connect with our other colleagues that are looking to deploy NGINX as well. So it means in actual fact, we're gonna have a better view of other areas that are wanting to use it or starting to use it. I think Dave, there's another couple of things that you're looking at as well?",

Because like Emma says it's that sort of integration, and it's breaking down those silos, which, you know, makes the department operate more efficiently, more effectively. And then is a perfect example of that is where we can use this add on to the NGINX deployment we've already got to start to integrate with other NGINX deployments and, you know, when you're talking about an organisation, the scale of the Department for Work and Pensions, and you can imagine that there are pockets of activity that take place that are very similar, or even using the same product, particularly where it's an open source version, where there isn't a central commercial avenue that people go through.",

It also simplifies it and he takes away some of the manual changes that people can make. So in terms of the actual backend configuration of NGINX, there's loads of configuration files that we have, and they\u2019re spread across multiple servers. As I talked about earlier on with our cluster servers, we've also got a UAT server.",

                "content": "So, in order to seamlessly transfer updates and changes and promote those from UAT into production, it's a fairly manual process. And as we all know, manual processes are prone to human error, that's natural. What this technology enables to do is to automate that and do it from a more programmatic perspective. So I think that'd be really valuable. Another key thing that we're that we're looking at, we have had in the past, an integration with our major data analytics platform Splunk, which is used very, very sort of, it's got a huge use us base in DWP now. And that is our central place for performing data analytics.",

Again, won't spread over multiple services, it\u2019s hard to do that individually. But if you can bring it all together, by integrating it with, with other products such as Splunk, then we have that central view. And it's not just for an engineer, it's for anybody that can look at it. So if there's an issue that somebody has anywhere that believes may be related to the NGINX reverse proxy by a user, or someone in the 24 by seven operations team, they can just hit this central dashboard and it's there. They can even look at it on the mobile devices they want. So, that's where we want to get to is to really sort of move ahead with integration, simplification, automation, and that sort of centralised, single pane of glass.",

And that's because of the various security restrictions that prevent that communication from the application through. But if we can present NGINX to the mobile devices that we use within DWP, very quickly you get the ability to be able to pull up dashboards, reports, and that can be really, really powerful.

Since then the team has gone from strength to strength, flying in earnest over thirty times to assess illegal and permitted waste sites and supporting other teams\u2019 work. Surveys and images from the drones greatly assist the Area\u2019s regulatory compliance and enforcement inspection work, capturing the full extent and scale of large sites, showing areas of permitted sites we cannot see from the ground, and quickly demonstrating unacceptable activities to operators.

The drone gives a unique perspective of a site, allowing officers to see inaccessible areas, often revealing hidden quantities of waste which may be of higher risk and to check compliance with notices we issue to remove waste.

More comprehensive regulatory inspections can be undertaken with drones too, for example assessing roofs, pipework and infrastructure above ground level which are not clearly visible to officers.

The recruitment process can present major barriers to autistic candidates due to features of autistic communication and thinking style. Autistic communication style can be literal and direct while thinking style can be logical and concrete. This, along with sensory differences and differences in body language, means that autistic candidates may have the skills and abilities to succeed in a role, but may not be able to demonstrate this in the typical assessment process.\u00a0 In order to break down these barriers, we worked with the team at DE&S to develop an autism friendly recruitment process.
