It was the days of Oxford's first major spin-out companies, when the process was handled through the office I began to work for in 1991, and long before the University's knowledge transfer firm really got going. It was a dynamic decade at Oxford, when the foundations for IP commercialisation were created, and it provided amazing opportunities for learning how academic knowledge could be translated for practical application and societal benefit. I ended up leading the service I had joined as a novice, and working in partnership with Isis Innovation (as it was back then - now Oxford University Innovation) - one of the most successful academic innovation companies in Europe. I want women to understand that experts in innovation develop through many and various complementary types of experiences.\u00a0There is no single starting point for success. Thirty years later, and having decided to move to a portfolio career, my early experience of working in innovation has translated into some fascinating non-executive opportunities on the Boards of 'BEIS family' organisations such as The Met Office and The National Physical Laboratory; the Copyright Licensing Agency; and, most recently, CPI Ltd - Centre for Process Innovation (part of the Advanced Manufacturing Catapult).",

Alongside this, by gaining experience, from both successes and failures, will help as evidence builds of entrepreneurial mindset, energy, ability to both spot opportunities and take tough commercial decisions. It is important that the innovators can access resources (including personal development opportunities) they need in creating new opportunities. From the idea creation followed by the commercialisation process, the heart of success is the innovator and the team. Give innovators the access to training opportunities where they can hone their skills, get them to work directly with entrepreneurs and tech investors who are used to evaluate disruptive innovations. The ability to create ideas which are deeply rooted in customer and market needs, clearly understand IP implications, the ability to articulate a commercial plan with financial and internal resources implications, are key areas of competence for success.",

We want to understand what the whole journey looks like, identify who\u2019s working on what aspects of it, and highlight places where one team\u2019s work is dependent on information or services being worked on by other teams. We hope the session will help us build our knowledge of the system and make contact with others working on parts of the system relevant to what we\u2019re working on.
