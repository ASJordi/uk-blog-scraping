Collecting these data has always been reliant on the goodwill of fisherman and vessel owners who agreed to take an observer onboard one of their commercial fishing trips to collect biological data from both the retained and discarded components of their catch. As a consequence of the COVID pandemic, both the industry activity and our sampling were seriously affected. Thankfully the industry were able to begin fishing again as their markets reopened, but it was not immediately possible to find an effective way of managing the COVID risk and returning to sampling at sea. Although some at sea sampling is now possible with sufficient mitigations in place, it is still limited to short trips and vessels with sufficient space for our observers to work safely with the crew. As observers started to return to sea, it was obvious that the data from these trips was not going to cover the range and extent of all the English fisheries we usually monitor.",

So for example, if the research question was about information architecture, we might use something like a card sort. Whereas if the research question concerned usability of a digital product, for example, we might use usability testing as our methodology. We also focus a lot on making sure the data collected are not skewed, for example, we wouldn't want a researcher asking leading questions. And we need to remain very open to finding out things that are not already on our agenda. And in a nutshell, I guess this is all about making sure the research is really robust and so the evidence that we gather is sound.",

So one of these is attitudinal versus behavioural, which simply means does the methodology provide insight about what the user actually does, which is their behaviour of course, or what they say they do, which is their attitude. And again, generally speaking, behavioural insight is considered of higher value. Because what people say they do is not always what they actually do when we want the real behaviours of our users. The other metric or continuum is qualitative versus quantitative. And this describes of course, whether the research data collected are numerical or not. So for example, something like the time users spend on a screen is very much quantitative, whereas something like their trust of government is rich, qualitative data. And because quantitative data tell us what people do, whereas quali data tells us why people do it, we wouldn't think about one of these as being better than the other.

So, methodologies like one on one interviews, retrospective interviews, understanding methodologies around usability testing with various participants of research. So very much like the qual, from a qual perspective, what's really important as Malcolm referenced, as well as a mixture of those methodologies. And from a quantitative perspective, it's in relation to the numbers and the volumes, and that's given us the, the what, and that generally feeds in to the why. So, if we've got a lot of what, from the quant side of things, as a researcher, I have a real interest in that, because it also helps me in the planning of future research and focus on the qual perspective in terms of the methodology that we're utilising as well.",

And that can have an influence ultimately on how well people are able to tell the story, how well they're able to evidence their research as well.

I think certainly from hearing stories that have been shared with me around experience of working in various sort of private sector roles. While they might have a degree of freedom, they are also under significant pressures in very different ways that we are in government.

If you're in a private beta, if you're in a public beta phase, if you're even in a live phase, there's always an opportunity to learn from the users and from the users that you've identified. And as a researcher, progressing through discovery into alpha into beta, running blended sessions, so if you're running usability sessions in an alpha, making sure that you're involving some sort of interview technique in those sessions to learn from those users, is still massively important and can provide real insight into the work that you're doing to the research that you're doing.",

So collaboration is really important as part of research, so collaborating amongst a team, collaborating in the wider UR community.

So, making sure that we collaborate across the different researchers is really important as well.

Being able to tell that story with the research in mind helps people understand the problem that you're trying to solve, but also is really important in relation to the research that's been conducted and the outputs and artefacts that have been created. So how you got to those outputs and artefacts, how you've created, for example, your user needs that are visible, how you've sort of fed into the user experience maps or the user journeys that you've created, how you've contributed and fed into your user profiles or your personas that have been created.

Chalk streams are an exceptional type of spring-fed river distinct to England and parts of France and Denmark. Although chalk exists in other parts of the world, nowhere else do we find these clear-watered rivers. In England, they are distributed across an arc of chalk that runs from Dorset to Yorkshire. Chalk streams \u2013 in their natural condition \u2013 are home to a profusion of life. When rain falls on chalk hills most of it soaks down into the body of the rock and there undergoes a kind of alchemy, emerging from springs as cool, alkaline, mineral-rich water, providing the perfect properties to create a richly diverse eco-system.\u00a0 Botanically, chalk streams are the most biodiverse of all English rivers. For invertebrates, fish, birds and mammals, they offer a vast range of habitat niches. They are our equivalent of the Great Barrier Reef, or the Okavango Delta: a truly special natural heritage and a responsibility.",

                "content": "My surveillance camera report covers the period between 2020-21 when my predecessor, Tony Porter, was in post and focuses on key activity and developments in the fast-evolving area of surveillance.\u00a0 The report covers issues such as the use of facial recognition technology and the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case brought against South Wales Police. It also covers activity that has been undertaken in furthering the National Surveillance Camera Strategy including body worn devices, automated number plate recognition and the long-awaited revision of the Code of Practice. \u00a0The report sets out the Commissioner\u2019s role and functions which the government has proposed transferring to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) along with those of the Biometrics Commissioner and is seeking views on the idea.\u00a0 My detailed response can be found here.\u00a0 For those who want to skip to the conclusion, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise or workable and I set out the evidential basis for that view in the formal response.\u00a0 In short, while there has always been a significant element of \u2018data protection\u2019 engaged in the area of camera surveillance, there are many respects in which the commissioner\u2019s functions are wider than upholding individual rights of the data subject.\u00a0 If people decide not to attend a public protest, for example, because they believe their photographs will be collected by the police, or fear their vehicle number plates will be stored for future monitoring, this would represent a significant impact on their fundamental rights in a mature democratic society but has little to do with data protection. Our data laws also have limits on which aspects of our lives they cover.\u00a0 For example, the hideous offending of a recently convicted murderer did not, so far as I can see, breach any \u201cdata protection principles\u201d even though he recorded his repellent abuse of human bodies in a hospital mortuary, because our data laws only protect the privacy and dignity of the living. While no official \u2018surveillance\u2019 was involved, there have since been calls to introduce mandatory CCTV in hospital mortuary areas as a result \u2013 were this to happen the limits of the laws that protect the ethical use of intrusive surveillance beyond data compliance would need to be reviewed.",

Although much harder to quantify, public concern still counts and while it does not lend itself to worries-per-1,000 parents or miles-by-anxious-motorist it is as real and present as the cameras in our streets, bus lanes, workplaces and schools.",

We need to be able to have confidence in the whole ecosystem of surveillance and be sure that what is technologically possible is only being done in a way that is both legally permissible and societally acceptable.\u00a0 That\u2019s the \u2018lightbulb\u2019 that needs changing here.
