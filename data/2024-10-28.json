England is home to approximately 85% of chalk streams across the world. They are home to rare and endangered species and are hotspots for invertebrates that thrive in chalk stream conditions.\u00a0",

These scores are used to calculate the River Macrophyte Nutrient Index. This index generates a score for the stretch of river being surveyed, and today it\u2019s Emma\u2019s job to survey a 100m section of channel in the River Mimram, identifying and recording plants as she goes.\u00a0",

So, it\u2019s a delicate balance.\u201d Aquatic plants are a fundamental component in rivers. They provide important habitat for fish and invertebrates, they can help to regulate water quality through the uptake of nutrients and production of oxygen, and their physical structure acts as a filter to settle sediment and create flow diversity.\u00a0",

We did this of course with the dairy industry using in place food safety surveillance programmes to monitor bulk milk samples, providing assurance that our cattle were not affected. The US situation again reminded us of the zoonotic potential of HPAI and the key importance of monitoring such viruses as they mutate and develop their potential in different species.

For British cattle, HAIRS conducted a risk assessment that interrogated the possible pathways of disease entry and the likelihood of human exposure to HPAI H5N1.

The assessment centre involved half a day of role plays, written reports, and an interview. A few days after the assessment centre I found out that I was successful and received my offer in December 2022, following the vetting process.
