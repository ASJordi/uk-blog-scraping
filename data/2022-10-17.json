Even in 2022, I have been on panels where people have said \u201c\u2026he looks like a project manager\u201d, whilst I am sitting there guessing I do not! We cannot relax and think we\u2019ve got it right, we have to ensure the right people are recruiting to clear standards and encourage potential applicants through allyship, and sponsorship. In government, the profession has serious resourcing challenges, so it is in all our interest to help build a more resilient, diverse profession.\u00a0",

This will provide an important forum for learning from each other across the diversity characteristics. Working together in this way will help make project delivery the best career choice for everyone. The network is in its infancy but has so much potential for learning from and supporting each other as allies, sponsors, and collaborators. It will not replace any of the valuable staff networks, it is very much profession-focused and allows us to bring our capabilities to building a brilliant profession for all.\u00a0",

So at the moment, my thoughts have turned to how we need to be bolder in taking action to encourage and keep Black and other minority groups in the profession. This can be done by acting as sponsors and mentors, showing up and supporting. The theme of Black History Month 2022 fits with the project delivery profession \u2018Time for Change \u2013 Actions not Words\u2019. It speaks to me and hopefully those who are looking for a great profession that offers fantastic opportunities in an increasingly diverse environment.\u00a0",
