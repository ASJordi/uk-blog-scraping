Captured a real variety of valuable responses ranging from practical things like recruitment briefs and prototype maturity to buy-in from teams. We generated ideas and actions of how to address these challenges and issues before prioritising next steps. You could do this in your own organisation.\u201d",

This gives you the time to ensure your participants represent not only a variety of access needs, but experiences too. Remember having an access need is personal, and two people with the same needs or conditions may use digital services differently. In terms of the research process, any accessibility defects should be identified before a product or service is used in research with users. If the issues cannot be resolved ahead of research sessions, the user researcher should be comfortable supporting participants with any workarounds. After the sessions, I like keeping participants in the loop about how their insights are used to drive change.\u201d",
