During the post war years, it was the threat of hunger and starvation that pushed innovation. Today, and while hunger remains a challenge in some parts of the world, there are more obese people than there are hungry ones. And where there is hunger, this tends not to be down to the global lack of food, but due to poverty and how the distribution of food is highly uneven.",

That approach can undermine the good practice being delivered by British farmers, if we're importing food produced to lower environmental standards on the other side of the world.

We have to find ways of being able to fix that, because not only will we need to rely on the push of policy, we're going to have to harness the pull of consumers to move beyond where we are now - producing as much food as possible as cheaply as possible - and instead into a place where we produce sustainable healthy food for everybody, while creating the conditions whereby we can do that indefinitely into the future.",

In terms of the research process, any accessibility defects should be identified before a product or service is used in research with users. If the issues cannot be resolved ahead of research sessions, the user researcher should be comfortable supporting participants with any workarounds. After the sessions, I like keeping participants in the loop about how their insights are used to drive change.\u201d",
