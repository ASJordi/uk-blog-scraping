This greatly reduced the possibility of a rejection, which allowed a much faster approval of trials, whilst maintaining our robust safety standards.\u00a0 Expert advice on COVID-19 applications was also provided to our Clinical Trials Unit from the Commission on Human Medicines expert working group.

From the outset of the NLW, firms have told us that where headcount would be reduced it would be more likely to come from reduced hiring rather than redundancies. This was supported by previous analysis by Frontier Economics, who found that employment growth is slower in the firms most affected by minimum wage increases [1].",

They use a technique pioneered by Cengiz et al (2019) [2], which involves comparing the loss of jobs immediately below the new minimum wage with the gain in jobs immediately above it. As the wage floor is increased, the number of jobs advertised below it decreases, while there is an increase in those paid at or above the new rate. The difference in the number of jobs shows the impact of the minimum wage on hiring behaviour.",

The approach that was used was unable to disentangle the effects of the NLW from nationwide shifts in hiring of workers at or just above the NLW. The initial results found that the NLW uprating caused the volume of vacancies to increase, along with statistically significant increases in apprentice vacancies following the increase in the Apprentice Rate. This is both surprising and extremely unlikely. It is more likely that the increases in these rates coincided with a substantial upswing in recruitment and employment activity, driven by the gradual opening of the economy taking place at the time.",

The only consistent evidence they found was an increase in the number of jobs advertised with the term \u201cexperience\u201d, suggesting that employers were increasingly looking for more experienced staff. Again, this could be related to the roadmap out of lockdown rather than being a direct impact of the NLW; on our visits we heard that several employers were seeking experienced staff so that they could hit the ground running as they reopened.",
