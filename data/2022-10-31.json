I firmly believe that the strength of One Health is its recognition of our world\u2019s deep interconnections and was personally very pleased to welcome UNEP and all its expertise as a valued Quadripartite member, given just how influential the environment is. Providing proper focus to the environment alongside human and animal health will allow us to effectively mitigate risks that could come from climate change or biodiversity loss, and UNEP\u2019s new global Nature for Health (N4H) initiative is now looking to support countries to improve their resilience in this area.",

This group aims to build the health capabilities of its members with relation to zoonotic disease and support stronger performance against the International Health Regulations. The overall ambition, of course, is to enable the implementation of guidance and models on behaviours, policies and practices that will minimise the impact of zoonotic diseases. Having reinvigorated the network and underpinned its objectives with a robust workplan (that has since been used as a framework for the Dutch chaired AMR Action Package) the membership has significantly expanded.

The drafting of the WHO\u2019s Pandemic Instrument\u00a0 provides an opportunity to address current gaps and establish valuable One Health underlying principles. This new global agreement will set new expectations for countries in order for the world to come together to better prevent, prepare for and respond to future pandemic risk.

They have also demonstrated that hazards, whether chemical or biological, present within the environment are amongst the most significant drivers of supply inefficiency in the sector (A seafood risk tool for assessing and mitigating chemical and pathogen hazards in the aquaculture supply chain). By focusing on developing better policies to control hazards within food sectors, we assert that more, safer food can be produced\u2013 or, that the same amount of food (meals) may be produced with a smaller environmental footprint.

We were shown around the current school building and then donned our hardhats and boots to enter the construction site. The site follows a similar construction plan to the new Littleborough building, using a blend of MMC and traditional methods.
