Although I ran those sessions, I\u2019m constantly learning about the tool itself and will be sharing what I learn as I go.\n\nIf you haven't run training before it can seem a bit stressful \u2013 that\u2019s okay. I was nervous when I did my first Figma workshop, so I did a dry run beforehand with one person. Starting with one or 2 people can help you get a feel for it, get feedback on what worked and what didn\u2019t go exactly as you envisioned and build your confidence to run the session with a larger group.",
