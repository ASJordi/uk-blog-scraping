The In-Year Reporting figure provided above for Russia comprises the value of all reported frozen assets, including bank accounts, payments, real estate, bullion, and other tangible and intangible assets. As Frozen Asset In-Year Reporting is a cumulative value of frozen assets at the time of freezing and does not determine or record subsequent changes, the published values as part of In-Year Reporting are likely to be higher than their actual value as the assets subsequently depreciate. For example, valuations of shares at the point of reporting will fluctuate, and funds may be legitimately drawn down through licensing. Unlike the annual Frozen Asset Review, In-Year Reporting identifies the last known value of shares reportedly held at the point of designation, where not already reported. Similarly, valuations of tangible assets reported as part of In-Year Reporting are made through publicly available information where not included in submitted reports.

It proposed how best to introduce a Net Gain policy for the marine environment and in March 2023, participants responses were released. They showed broad support for MNG as well as a range of recommendations around what MNG could cover, how it could be applied to developments within it and which Net Gain interventions would be most appropriate at sea.\u00a0\u00a0",
