Developments such as this increase opportunities to join up societal initiatives such as health and education and engage the public in a place where they frequent and feel comfortable, often located in the heart of their local community. Initiatives such as Culture Nature provide an opportunity for those from underrepresented groups to experience nature first-hand within their local community.
