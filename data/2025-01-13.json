The first removals of radioactive sludge from this pond were made possible using equipment and systems researched, designed, installed, and commissioned by this joint venture. This venture was cited for the way it embraced innovation by utilising pioneering 3D design technology and for furthering the advances that were made in decommissioning a highly active, legacy facility, in areas such as the cleaning and preparation of the pond walls and installing pipe bridges and sludge-pumping platforms.

What I have always loved about kelp is that they are ecosystem engineers - they create habitat through their structure. This means they provide shelter, nursery grounds, and feeding grounds to a wide array of species, as the kelp forest holds numerous food sources. This includes species such as sea snails, sea urchins and limpets.

I have myself witnessed the increase of bleached kelp during heat waves, and escalating storms destroying entire parts of kelp forests. The warming waters induce a change of ecosystem too. Species of kelp are starting to migrate north, and non-native species of both seaweeds and animals are arriving in the UK. In the film, the eerily graceful and luminous crystal jellyfish is captured, a species common in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean, but a visitor to our seas.\u00a0",
