They create some of the most productive habitats on the planet and can be found not far from the shoreline. Kelp forests themselves can act as a buffer against storms, increase oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide and absorb anthropogenic nutrients. What I have always loved about kelp is that they are ecosystem engineers - they create habitat through their structure. This means they provide shelter, nursery grounds, and feeding grounds to a wide array of species, as the kelp forest holds numerous food sources. This includes species such as sea snails, sea urchins and limpets. Despite their resilience however, they are at risk from disappearing from our seas \u2013 in the Northeast Atlantic, both their reduced distribution and decreased genetic diversity have been reported.",

Species of kelp are starting to migrate north, and non-native species of both seaweeds and animals are arriving in the UK.
