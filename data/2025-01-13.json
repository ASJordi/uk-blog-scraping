The first removals of radioactive sludge from this pond were made possible using equipment and systems researched, designed, installed, and commissioned by this joint venture. This venture was cited for the way it embraced innovation by utilising pioneering 3D design technology and for furthering the advances that were made in decommissioning a highly active, legacy facility, in areas such as the cleaning and preparation of the pond walls and installing pipe bridges and sludge-pumping platforms. This partnership has now evolved, with The Decommissioning Alliance (TDA), constituted by many of the same partners, still supporting FGMSP via the Decommissioning Delivery Partnership.",

What I have always loved about kelp is that they are ecosystem engineers - they create habitat through their structure. This means they provide shelter, nursery grounds, and feeding grounds to a wide array of species, as the kelp forest holds numerous food sources. This includes species such as sea snails, sea urchins and limpets.
