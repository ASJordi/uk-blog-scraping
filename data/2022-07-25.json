I think that\u2019s really important for me and my team to make sure that we\u2019ve got a wide breadth of knowledge and we can answer as many customer queries as we possibly can. We\u2019re continually refreshing our approach with farmers and land managers as we use the insight gained to influence delivery and inform the development of future schemes.

We also have the opportunity for customers to have a quick watch of the SFI \u2018How to apply\u2019 video. So, lots of good, interesting things on the stand as well. What I\u2019ve found is most customer queries have focused on what the future holds, in terms of current an new schemes and what support was going to be available once BPS reduces. This is obviously a really wide-reaching feeling within the industry. Many of the farmers were interested in grant support and when future rounds would be open for applying.

                "content": "Sandy: So James, just before we get down to an update, I thought it would be useful just to give you and people listening a bit of an insight or context setting around what SFI is. So, at its core, SFI\u2019s around incentivising and rewarding sustainable actions that support food production and enhance environmental outcomes. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that SFI is part of a wider environmental land management approach, which was a key aspect of the agricultural transition, which also includes Landscape Recovery and Local Nature Recovery. The full set of standards we\u2019re expecting to be ready by 2025, and that is essentially focusing on improving water quality, biodiversity, climate change mitigation and animal health and welfare. But like anything we\u2019ve talked about, the incremental nature of the agricultural transition period, we\u2019ve started simply, focusing on actions and standards to essentially improve soil health, to recognise the importance of moorland and to improve animal health and welfare. The standards have been designed working with farmers, and I think that\u2019s really important for people to understand, and actually as I said, we\u2019ll introduce new ones over the next few years. We get a lot of questions around eligibility, so who is eligible to apply for SFI. So initially it\u2019s open to farmers claiming BPS, and I think that\u2019s an important aspect of the consideration. I know a lot of farmers that undertake a lot of the actions that sit within the standards but actually can\u2019t be bothered with the paperwork. And actually what I\u2019m hoping we will see, as and when we deliver SFI, and SFI matures as a scheme, that they\u2019ll look to embrace the scheme and be rewarded for the things in most cases they are doing already. So, it is open to everyone, those that are in existing environmental schemes \u2013 at the moment that\u2019s predominantly Countryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship \u2013 can apply but they\u2019ll need to call the RPA and actually we will support them through the application process. I think that\u2019s really, really important for people to understand. I think that one of the things that also comes across in terms of questions is \u2018can I apply for SFI if I\u2019m in CS or I\u2019m in ES?\u2019. And actually, an element of that is around yes you can, but actually we won\u2019t be able to be providing funding for the same actions. So actually if you\u2019re doing something in one scheme, we\u2019re not going to be able to reward you for doing the same actions in another scheme. So actually you can complement the two schemes but essentially they have to be delivering different actions. One of the things that we\u2019ve often heard as well from farmers is the inflexibility around the application windows, so it\u2019s really good to see that for SFI, there are no application windows. Farmers can apply when it suits them best, and actually that\u2019s really helpful in the way that it adds a degree of flexibility. And obviously we\u2019ll issue quarterly payments once the agreements have started. We\u2019ve opened up a new service to apply, and actually what\u2019s really interesting about the approach that we\u2019ve taken, it includes some automated checks, and actually these checks are making it simpler and more straightforward. We\u2019ve been working with farmers to learn from their experience of using the service and actually we\u2019ve been able to introduce some measures that have improved that experience. So actually everything is working quite nicely, everything that farmers need to know about the scheme and application process is available on rpa.gov.uk, and I\u2019d encourage farmers to get involved.",

Farmers are applying and that\u2019s really great to see. They are telling us that the process has been easy to follow. The upfront checks have made things simpler for us, and what we\u2019ve been able to do is process applications quicker. Our aim is to get agreement offers out within two months, but in truth, some of the applications are being processed a lot quicker than that. Which I think is really helpful, and if you compare that to the existing schemes we currently have which can take up to four-to-five months plus, I think getting things out quicker is a really great improvement that we\u2019ve made. And actually, as I\u2019ve said before, the link between the start of the agreement offer, and the payment is really, really important. So, payments will be flowing on a quarterly basis, as soon as the agreement has started. But we know this is a really busy time for farmers and actually again, the advantage of having a rolling window means that farmers can apply when they\u2019re ready to apply, which I think is really, really helpful.",

So in the SFI standards we\u2019ve described some minimum actions which will help to deliver the aims of the standards but actually we\u2019re really focused on trusting farmers to do the how, and actually working with them in terms of the outcomes we want to achieve. As I\u2019ve said before, many of the actions that sit within the standards farmers do already. One of the key things in there will be a move away from applying penalties. Where we find something that isn\u2019t in accordance with the agreement, we\u2019ll work with the farmer to figure out how we can remedy the situation collectively. But I think there\u2019s an important thing to make clear here; we have a number of considerations that we need to balance in the delivery of our schemes. Obviously a desire to work with farmers to deliver environmental outcomes is high on our agenda, but we also have an obligation to protect taxpayers\u2019 money to ensure that it is prudently spent. But like out approach to our new service, there will be learning that we will need to consider as and when we rollout our particular visits.",

And I\u2019ll give you a good example; so I was in Hastings a couple of weeks ago, speaking to a room of farmers. One farmer, at the end, came up to me and said how grateful he was around the support that he received from one of our field officers at a recent visit.

I think the RPA in particular knows the importance of cash flow to rural businesses. And certainly we understand the impact that these BPS advances will make given the challenging times that we\u2019re facing. We announced on 19th July that payments had begun to be issued. I expect the majority of farmers to receive their payment by the end of July. There will be a small number of claims that will require additional processing, and what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll be in touch with farmers who are affected but we\u2019ll continue to release BPS advances across August, once this further work has been completed. Payments will broadly be around 50% of the value of the claim, but there will be some variances as there always are. What we\u2019ll do is when we issue the balance payments from December, we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments. Importantly, for both advances and balance payments, farmers will get a remittance advice and that\u2019s something that they\u2019re used to getting before, and actually claim statements will be issued after the balance payments have been made from December. I think, every year we sit on payments that we\u2019ve issued, and actually this is a call for action for those people that haven\u2019t provided us with their updated contact details. It\u2019s always interesting to see money sitting with the RPA when it should be in farmers\u2019 banks accounts because they haven\u2019t provided us with their up-to-date banking details.

A lot of those actions need to be completed by 31 May 2024, but also farmers can retain up to five hectares of their land and still receive their lump sum payment. Most of the information around some of the schemes are available on rpa.gov.uk.

More information again is available on the gov.uk pages, and I think farmers will need to search for \u201cSlurry Infrastructure grant\u201d. I think the important thing with all of these schemes as and when we move across the agricultural transition period, that they have been co-designed with farmers, and actually I think that\u2019s really, really important. But actually not just farmers but industry and environmental experts. The application process is again similar to what farmers are used to applying for. So, it\u2019s a two-stage process, starting with an online eligibility checker, which will open in the autumn, followed by a full application process over the winter. So there will be multiple opportunities to apply for a grant. So if you\u2019re not successful in the first round, there will be other rounds over the next couple of years or so.

Turning milk into cheese or yoghurt for instance, processing meat into sausages, and potatoes into crisps or chips; or equipment such as vending machines and display facilities for selling food directly to customers. Although the online checker closed on 21 July, there will be a scoring mechanism and actually if your score is high enough, you\u2019ll be invited to submit a full application, which will need to be sent with supporting documents into the Agency by email.\u202fSuccessful projects will be provided with details about how to do this when the scheme opens for applications later in the year, and you\u2019ll have until 31 January 2024 to submit the full application. If you need planning permission, then this must be approved and submitted with your full application.

Foresters manage rides, glades and open areas across their landholding \u2013 and particularly in the priority areas - to provide plenty of \u201cecotones\u201d or transition between wooded and open habitat. This is really helping species such as the broad-bordered bee hawk-moth (above) \u2013 a beautiful day-flying moth that mimics bee colours and behaviour and depends on open clearings.",

Recently a rare moth returned to Savernake Forest in Wiltshire for the first time in 120 years after sympathetic conservation work was carried out. The Light Crimson Underwing (above) needs plenty of veteran oak trees to breed and feed and is usually found in ancient woodland and wood pasture or parkland. It had been almost confined to the New Forest but has now been found in Dorset and Wiltshire and seems to be increasing slightly in recent years.",

According to a University College London study, moths are important pollen transporters in English farmland and might play a role in supporting crop yields, The research, published in Biology Letters, shows that moth pollen transport networks are larger and more complex than networks for daytime pollinators.",
