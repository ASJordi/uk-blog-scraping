This is then used and explored for a large number of statistical purposes, so the system has a wide base of stakeholders and purposes, and it interfaces with a number of other ONS systems to meet these. Offering enhanced functionality, the SBR is intended to replace a legacy system called the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR); this older system will continue in dual running for a little while, for which it will continue to be managed by another team entirely. However it\u2019s likely involvement will also be required in helping ensure the new SBR is meeting user needs, using technical expertise in judging confidence levels in different areas over time, for fully transitioning from the older system.",
