I\u2019ve met many organisations and stakeholders who provide services to our customers and that\u2019s a really great community of people who also want to work in partnership with us. It\u2019s been my first year at RPA, so as well as being my first year in the role, it\u2019s been my first year working with colleagues and another observation would be that the passion and the willingness to deliver great outcomes has been shown right across the agency.

We\u2019ve supported thousands of customers this year to access funding so as well as continuing to deliver funding through existing schemes, we\u2019ve delivered a variety of new schemes and new grants. We\u2019ve then improved how our customers can contact us, how they can get through to the right person on our telephone lines or by web chats, how they can tell us about information and changes and then how we can better direct their queries or information they\u2019re sharing with us to the right people. We\u2019ve increased the way we share information to reach more customers, so this is things like our newsletters, videos to show guidance, videos to share real life examples from customers on how they\u2019re using our funding to deliver great outcomes and then of course things like this podcast. I talked about our stakeholder community and we engage with a large number of stakeholders and that\u2019s a really important group. Some of our customers choose to be members of these organistions and some choose to use land agents, for example. So in the last year we\u2019ve increased how much we get out and about, whether that\u2019s at shows and events or whether it\u2019s how we inform and engage with our stakeholders through meetings and workshops and getting out and about in our rural communities. In the last year we launched our farmer panel and that\u2019s really important for us to gather insight but also test some of those improvements that we\u2019re making and we\u2019ve increased our customer insight activity. So, what I mean by that is how we capture feedback from that broad group of customers I talked about, in different ways and at different parts of their interaction with us. We get feedback in such a variety of ways \u2013 direct, so say from a customer survey or from the farmer panel or perhaps a social media comment, but also indirectly through our data and our performance information, and from colleagues out in the field or taking calls from our customers. So we\u2019re improving how we pull all that together to help drive improvements across our services.",

Previously under EU funding we\u2019ve had to inspect and check compliance against agreements. While it\u2019s important to ensure that our public money is being used for good, \u00a0we want to move more towards supporting our customers to deliver those brilliant outcomes, helping them to get it right, preventing mistakes happening, so that\u2019s a real shift in what\u2019s expected of our field colleagues. I talked earlier about the increased funding streams that we\u2019ve provided, whether that\u2019s schemes or grants. All of that means that our colleagues, on the telephones or in the fields, need to be more informed to advise, guide and support customers, so we\u2019re keen to upskill our contact centre colleagues so that they can provide accurate and useful information to our customers. With all of that we also need to provide the technology to support colleagues in delivering those services.",

We\u2019ve talked a little bit today about the different customer groups that we provide support to, and what that means is that different customers want to contact us in different ways at different times of the day or the week and for some customers the type of service they like differs, so whether they want \u00a0to be able to self-serve that information without needing to talk to a person, they want to be able to get information quickly, tell us of changes quickly at a time that\u2019s convenient for them, or whether it\u2019s face to face contact in the field or whether they want to speak to that person about multiple things to do with their farm or business, so one of the things we\u2019re looking for in the next 12 months is to look at the best contact model we can provide, both in the field, over the phone or through our customer portal, how do we provide the right contact model for all of the customers we\u2019re trying to support, so we absolutely want to give customers a choice in how they engage but we also want to make sure that whatever way they choose, they receive a consistent and a great service.",

So for some customers they\u2019re quite happy to self-serve information and to tell us of changes without necessarily talking to a person, whereas for others they\u2019d like more complex support, they\u2019d like to talk to a person, whether that\u2019s in the field or over the phone, so we\u2019d like to improve how we engage, how we support customers to deliver those outcomes and how we make it easier for customers to get the information and support they need from us.

Natural England is here to help and advise farmers and land managers to understand the special responsibilities that come with working and farming on these precious sites, including through schemes that compensate and support land managers for their efforts. At the same time, it has been my experience that the best innovation and new ideas come from farmers themselves \u2013 they know the land and how it responds to management better than anyone.
