The way we\u2019re working today is creating complexity in our technology landscape, and if we can\u2019t change that then we will always be in a technical debt cycle. We need to break the cycle of creating complex policy then complex processes to deliver that policy and then complex systems to support those processes. So the third thing that needs to be different in 2025 is the way that we work \u2013 we need to be working in a truly multidisciplinary way with policy and operational colleagues from the inception of a policy idea.

Although we've always focused that, I guess from a financial and resourcing point of view, it's no different to the sustainability angle that we're talking about now and in DWP Digital, that's what we're about.

So, it's happening now. And the sort of work we do in IT is us doing our part. I took this from a book that looked at the true carbon footprint. And there's also something called the Carbon Literacy Trust. Well, what they looked at was how much carbon does sending a simple email cost. And they estimated that with the actual creation of the email, the network transmission, and the time taken when somebody actually read it, it was about three grams of carbon dioxide for a basic email. If you wrote an email to 100 people, and only just one of them read it, the calculation came out that it was around 56 grams of carbon dioxide. So, the way we use our technology, actually we do things simpler when you use things like teams, for example, you only post something once, rather than having individual copies.
