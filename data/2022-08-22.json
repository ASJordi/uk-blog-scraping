As we approach the end of the summer, water is still as critical as ever for farmers. \u00a0Many farmers have limited water remaining in their storage reservoirs and little volume left on their annual licensed abstraction so are taking difficult decisions on which crops to irrigate with this precious resource. Many farmers have stopped irrigating fields to save water for harvesting crops. The harvesting of some root crops like potatoes requires water to soften dry hardened soils sufficiently so that crops are not bruised. Farmers are also looking ahead to their water needs for the winter to help establish newly sown and planted crops such as brassicas and cereals and to refill their reservoirs ahead of next year\u2019s irrigation season.",

Wet fencing to manage livestock on marshland grazing is drying out and abstractors who normally take water from ditches are being asked to stop to ensure the fencing is still effective. With the lack of rain and grass dying off, farmers are already having to feed their animals with winter forage. This means, combined with reduced silage production, they may need to buy in additional forage later in the winter. Milk production is already down. Some support is already available for farmers through such actions as temporarily easing environmental stewardship scheme rules.\u00a0 Support for farmers on dry weather impacts - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)",

Where there is a real or imminent threat to crops and livestock, farmers can contact the Environment Agency to discuss availability of water. While numbers of these requests (currently in the low tens) have been relatively few compared to the many thousands of agriculture and irrigation licences, we know that as the dry conditions continue, we will see more farmers come forward for help harvesting crops and refilling their storage reservoirs. \u00a0We are operating our water transfer schemes to help maintain river flows and groundwater levels to support wildlife and facilitate abstraction. The Environment Agency is now actively looking at how they can potentially support farmers accessing water for early refill of winter storage reservoirs. We are also carrying out irrigation patrols and other compliance checks to ensure all abstractors are complying with their licence conditions to help protect water availability.",

Natural England staff organise the monitoring and tagging of these nests, and provide support and guidance on diversionary feeding and brood management. We recognise the efforts put into these activities by these estates and their staff, as well as those of our other partners in the Brood Management Trial. The total number of 119 fledglings this year includes 13 brood-managed chicks, taken from four nests on grouse moors and reared to fledging in captivity. We were pleased that all 13 were released as healthy full-grown birds, and also to see brood-managed birds from previous years breeding successfully (five individuals, producing 10 chicks between them in 2022). A formal assessment and evaluation of both the practicalities of this technique and its role in changing attitudes to hen harriers will inform a decision on its future role.",

Tests including a post mortem examination were carried out, led by our partners at the Institute of Zoology, during which the bird was found to have been suffering from symptoms of respiratory disease and tested positive for avian influenza (AI) virus and Capillaria spp nematode worms, either, or both, of which may have been associated with death.
