Further positive signs were seen in spring 2024, now predominantly exhibited by the females, with no fewer than 24 eggs laid. As the birds did not copulate this year all the eggs were infertile, so no juvenile harriers will be released in 2024. Nevertheless, their laying is an excellent indicator of good health and welfare condition of the female harriers and a further step in the right direction towards successful breeding. The birds also showed promising maternal behaviours, such as building nests and incubating the eggs, and even tentative attempts to copulate \u2013 further indication of their readiness to breed.

So far, nearly 2000 SCS, including some of the most senior leaders across government have completed the survey, which enables leaders to rate their skills against those outlined in the Digital and Data Essentials -\u00a0 a framework created with the leadership skills needed both now and in the future in mind.
