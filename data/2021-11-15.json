Quite simply, many of these children need support to get them back on track and to close some of the attainment gaps which developed over the course of the pandemic. To create a culture in which we support all of our pupils to strive to achieve their best, as well as model to them the correct behaviours and link this to the school being a safe environment, is crucial to develop our pastoral performance \u2013 with a view that this will, in turn, promote success inside and outside of the classroom.",
