Business Analysis came first and resulted in the production of numerous Use Cases, UML models and Business Rules. Use Cases were high level, lacking detail, and perhaps most importantly - difficult to change. If it was found during development or testing that something in the Use Case was unfeasible, illogical, or for some other reason \u2018just plain wrong', a bug would be created, and the ticket would go back to the BA for further investigation.

Ironically, what I as a tester at the time was most anxious about wasnt a new way of working, it was about \u2018not knowing all the things\u2019 upfront. What if we introduced a bug because we didn't see the joined-up picture? The concept of small user stories, small bits of delivery that were self-contained, and only one piece of the jigsaw, scared me because I was so used to the pie being sliced the other way - large documents that covered an entire activity, albeit in less detail.\u00a0",

I started managing the backlog, breaking our delivery down into Themes, then Epics, then User Stories.
