In 2010, a separate \u2018Apprentice Rate\u2019 was brought in, set lower than other rates (initially at just \u00a32.50 per hour). The Apprentice Rate is the minimum hourly rate an employer can pay their apprentice if they are aged 16-18 or in the first year of their apprenticeship if older[1].",

As a SSAC member however, our job is to scrutinise draft legislation and to assess whether it will achieve the government\u2019s policy intent, or whether there may be unintended consequences, and to advise the Secretary of State accordingly.

However, I came to the view that my technical skills in respect of understanding legislation, combined with my knowledge and understanding of how that translates into the impact on, and experience of, claimants would be a useful perspective for the Committee so I bit the bullet and applied!

However, I have soon learned, through SSAC, that legal analysis without the full social context is by itself quite inert.

It is reassuring to see from the inside, how SSAC works rigorously and independently at assessing newly proposed legislation and manages to reach a collective view on recommendations to be out forward for the Secretary of State to consider. The breadth of SSAC membership, from charity leaders, housing, disability and welfare rights experts to academics, including covering most devolved nations, makes SSAC an incredibly stimulating and enjoyable Committee to work within.",

For example, upon reflection, much of my experience to-date has been scrutinising some highly technical and complex social security regulations which impacts on fellow citizen\u2019s lives. Consequently, it is not a task taken lightly, given the consequences. However, being able to discuss with such experienced colleagues means that when SSAC advises a Secretary of State, the Public can be reassured of the thoroughness and rigour of the debate underlying the proposed legislation.
