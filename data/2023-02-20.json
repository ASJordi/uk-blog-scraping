BNG is one way that land can be managed to better our natural environment and generate an income from doing so. Whether on a large estate, a smaller piece of land or a network of sites across the country, BNG provides an opportunity to enter a market where \u2018biodiversity units\u2019 are bought and sold with the aim of delivering outcomes for nature that can also support economic growth.",

They will use the biodiversity metric, expected to be version 4.0, to calculate how many biodiversity units they need, in order to achieve this.

Creating or enhancing habitats on your land generates these biodiversity units which you can, in turn, sell to developers. The market represents a potential chance to diversify your income. Indeed, it is expected to be worth \u00a3135m - \u00a3274m annually.\nFurther guidance is still anticipated on how BNG will operate and Natural England will continue to support government in its development. To help kick-start this activity, Defra has put together some advice to support anyone looking to sell biodiversity units: Sell biodiversity units as a land manager.",

For example, habitats created or improved in advance of sale generate more \u2018biodiversity units\u2019, therefore starting habitat works early could benefit you longer term. If you\u2019re not yet in a position to start creating or enhancing habitats, then there are still things that can be done. This might be starting to establish baselines for your land, using the Biodiversity Metric to explore the possibilities and what might be appropriate.\nWe\u2019d also recommend starting the conversation in your local area, whether this is with your Local Planning Authority, environmental organisations, land agents and others, to understand what the local priorities for nature recovery might be and what types of habitats developers might need to achieve net gain.\nKeep up to date with the latest information here.",

The Enforcement Undertaking required them to restore the riverbank by allowing the coppiced willows to regrow in addition to reinstating washed river gravels to provide spawning habitat for fish and provide material to support natural processes. Additional compensation included the provision of suitable refuges for the notified fish species to reduce the risk of predation.
