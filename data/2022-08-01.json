Having a multidisciplinary scientific network allows you to more easily connect science from seemingly disparate areas. A good network contains colleagues from other professions, as effectively utilising in Government requires an understanding of the non-scientific structures and processes, and input from colleagues who specialise in these areas, such as commercial, finance, and HR. Individuals from all professions will have interesting insights that might not be initially obvious to scientists and engineers, and it is important to make sure your network does not become too siloed.",

The Biodiversity Metric is a key tool that supports the delivery of Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG). It is used to calculate the baseline biodiversity value of a site and forecast its future biodiversity value. The launch of this consultation is a key milestone in the countdown towards the commencement of mandatory BNG for Town and Country Planning Act developments in November 2023. The same requirement will come into force for developments under the 2008 Planning Act by the end of 2025.",

Since then, Natural England has worked with others within Government and with external stakeholders and partners, to further develop and refine the Metric. In 2019 we launched version 2.0 of the metric, followed two years later by version 3.0. In April we released Biodiversity Metric version 3.1 and subsequently recommended to Defra that it become the metric to be used to underpin mandatory biodiversity net gain. Alongside the release of Biodiversity Metric 3.1 we released a streamlined version of the metric developed for use on small development sites, called the Small Sites Metric. These two metrics are now being formally consulted on ahead of the publication of, what will become, the Secretary of State\u2019s officially sanctioned biodiversity metric(s) to be used for mandatory BNG.",

The intention is that these two metrics will then remain stable and unchanged for a period of between 3 and 5 years. This will provide certainty and consistency for all metric users. However, any metric needs to evolve and develop over time in response to new knowledge, science and technology. This will be the case with the Biodiversity Metric. Natural England will continue to work behind the scenes, together with Defra group colleagues, metric users and other interested parties, on future metric updates and developments. Based on this work, users experience of the metric and our own evaluation of its impact and performance, we will make periodic recommendations to the Secretary of State about ways the metric could be further developed or improved. This could include the values and multipliers within the metric, the scope and content of the metric and the platform on which it is based. Any substantive change to the metric will be subject to additional consultations before adoption. In short, this is the start of the metric journey, not its end.",
