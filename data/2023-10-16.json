I now wish I\u2019d been offered this opportunity years ago when I first started the menopause transition when I was 46 years old. The menopause specialist had a plan and realised that I had been plodding along for the last four years and made some tweaks to my already prescribed medication. You also get a 15 min review 12 weeks after your initial appointment.\u00a0My advice would be, don\u2019t hesitate to book up and get\u00a0 reassurance from an experienced specialist.

In this introduction we started to form our working relationship and got to know each other better. The strong level of trust needed between the social worker and ourselves was something we weren\u2019t prepared for. In truth, the process can be a hard slog, so having a trusted social worker who can guide you throughout the process is so important. Essentially, your social worker should be someone you would trust to understand all your personal details and eventually set you up with the right child. Also, particularly as a LGBT+ couple you want someone with an understanding of same sex couples and holds no preconceived ideas. If you\u2019re not comfortable with your current social worker, you can ask to change. You will not be judged for doing this and it will help you in the long term.",
