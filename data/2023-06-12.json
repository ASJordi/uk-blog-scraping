While this may cause the mother birds to flee the nest, which is an obvious and immediate response, this could have longer term impacts, such as chick predation or the mother\u2019s energy reserves being depleted, which are not immediately noticeable.

Chalk streams are a rare and valuable habitat, often referred to as the equivalent of England\u2019s rainforests.\u00a0It is estimated that 85% of the world\u2019s chalk streams are in England and around 29% of these are in East Anglia. Most water we drink in the east, comes from rainwater stored deep beneath our feet in natural chalk \u2018aquifers\u2019, which also feed our chalk streams.",

We added woody debris to narrow the river, after it was historically altered to help with milling, this will benefit wildlife and improve water quality. Another factor that is in the forefront of my mind is how we can make our projects greener. With this restoration, the Norfolk River Trust project manager used heavy horses to bring the wood on site, this meant heavy machinery wasn\u2019t needed and in turn reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint.

It will also help habitats to absorb water in high flows and then slowly release it during the summer months which will benefit wildlife and help during times of drought. This was done by enhancing farmland and reversing historic drainage work to create a shallow meandering channel which reconnected the river with the surrounding floodplain. This will keep the soil wet which should mitigate against the climate crisis as it will reduce the carbon lost from the organic matter in the soil.\u00a0 In times of high water, when the streams usually carries sediment, the stream will spread onto the floodplain meaning the sediment leaves the chalk stream. This improves water quality and in stream habitat quality as there is less fine sediments being deposited on river gravels leaving them to be clear and have spaces in between the stones for invertebrates.",

The work will\u00a0 improve water quality in this chalk stream and has established a diverse habitat for nature to thrive including water voles and eels. The hope is that work may even lead to the re-introduction of the bullhead, a small brown mottled fish also known as miller\u2019s thumb, this species was historically wiped out. This work is complemented by a project with Norfolk Rivers Trust to restore eels to the catchment by allowing easier passage for elvers (young eels) around mills. I am currently working with students from University of East Anglia to better understand the issues for eels around certain structures and where the most suitable site is to re-introduce the bullhead. We are also preparing for phase 2 of the Riverlands project which will have more of a focusing on restoring the hydrology I will be exploring nature-based solutions that will help to do this.

But when you must change and not touch things on the floor and contaminate things, you fnd yourself stood on one leg quite frequently. So it's helpful to have people around you to help you whilst you are guided into a cumbersome, muti-layered suit. It takes, I don't know, 10 minutes. It's not massively difficult, but just to know about the little techniques - put your glove that way, tape it in place this way because when you put on the suit it twists if it isn't lined up, all really helps.",
