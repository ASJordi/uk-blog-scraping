Natural England satellite-tracks hen harriers in order to investigate patterns of dispersal and survival, and the causes of any deaths. I said in my last blog that some areas of Natural England\u2019s hen harrier recovery work remain controversial, and this is especially so because illegal persecution rightly evokes strong feelings for all of us. This is the story of one of our tagged hen harriers, Asta, and what happened to her.",

Concerns were raised when Asta appeared to suddenly move to a new location \u2013 near Arrathorne, south-east of Richmond \u2013 and stopped moving. As always, the police were immediately informed, and no efforts were spared in tracking down the tag. Finding tags calls for considerable expertise, and our dedicated staff spent many long hours chasing the signals. What they eventually found was shocking and unexpected: the tag, which they had last seen on the healthy nestling Asta, attached to the scavenged carcass of a carrion crow. It was hard to make sense of this finding, but our staff acted fast, involving the police and other specialists.",

This is a serious allegation which we strongly reject.

In many cases the birds and tags will never be found \u2013 some of these losses will be birds that have been shot or trapped, and the bodies and tags hidden or disposed of, while others will be due to natural mortality, with low battery levels or topography meaning that the final signals are too imprecise for the tag to be tracked down. Still others could be due to tags failing while the birds are still alive. Whatever the possible reason, all tags that stop transmitting will continue to be referred to the police, and will be kept on file by the National Wildlife Crime Unit and local police forces, who monitor patterns of disappearances and take action where warranted.

For me, the bottom line is that being a good policy maker means knowing who your policies are affecting, in what ways and how these impacts differ for different groups of people. This is not a nice-to-have nor an add-on, but a core part of the role.",

This is how we\u2019ll tackle the\u00a0disproportionate impacts that some policies have on certain groups and improve policy overall for all. Not only is this an obvious way to make effective and efficient policy, it is also a legal requirement placed on every public sector worker under the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED). It requires all public authorities to pay due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between people. Considering equalities in policy design is also important to achieve fairness and remain in accordance with Civil Service values, particularly to act with integrity.",

However, this sort of practice was not done uniformly across departments.\u00a0For example, we quickly discovered that the masks given to frontline workers were tested on the \u2018Sheffield head\u2019, a mannequin head modelled on a 6\u20191\u2019\u2019 Caucasian male, meaning it was not effective on a large number of staff who did not fit this description. Brilliant teams from the Department for Health and Social Care and the NHS collected data on the diverse range of staff from across the NHS via an online survey and used the findings to engage effectively with different manufacturers. The result was the use of a broader range of face shapes and sizes in manufacture design and prototypes (including men and women, different ethnicities and different ages) and testing of masks on a diverse range of people including glasses wearers and deaf people.",

During Tim\u2019s time, the accountability of Senior Responsible Owners (SROs) for major programmes was strengthened, making them directly accountable to Parliament. Tim also introduced the first ever Project Delivery Fast Stream and the Fast Track apprenticeship scheme. He started the work on codifying the capabilities needed for particular roles in delivering projects. Tim started making real progress when instead of trying to do things within the MPA, he turned his delivery model inside out and started co-creating with departments. Speaking of this work, Tim recollects \u201cthe progress we started making was phenomenal. The number who identified as project delivery professionals numbered about 10,000 by 2015.\u201d\u00a0",

Nick joined the then re-formed Infrastructure and Projects Academy (IPA) from Mott Macdonald, with extensive delivery experience from both the private and public sectors. Nick and his small team were immediately pulled into EU Exit transition planning, plugging significant skills gaps across the government by redeployment and upskilling. The team launched the first ever cross-departmental project delivery recruitment campaigns that successfully drew in significant numbers of new project delivery professionals to the Civil Service. At this time, he commissioned and ran the EU Exit Programme and Project Leadership (PPL) training. Building on this work, the team formalised the Project Delivery Capability Framework (PDCF), which articulates the competencies required for all project delivery roles. Nick also led the development of a new government online skills assessment tool, Government Online Skills Tool (GOST), that helps government project delivery professionals assess their skills against their current roles and ambitions in a structured way. Nick introduced the first version of the Government Project Delivery Standard and created the highly sought-after development programme \u2018Orchestrating Major Programmes\u2019, aimed at Director Generals and Chief Executive Officers overseeing significant portfolios of change in their departments. HM Treasury also agreed to send spending teams on major project development programmes run by the Major Projects Leadership Academy faculty. The departmental HoPs continued to be the engine for project delivery development over this period. By the end of Nick\u2019s tenure, the government project delivery profession adopted the symbol of a black swan as its emblem, in recognition of those improbable, but highly impactful events that experienced project delivery teams get adept at managing.\u00a0",

Her time in the IPA saw a concerted effort to build on these foundations to develop a more systemic framework of standards and guidance for government project delivery, with a range of products co-created with the profession. These included guidance for SROs and the \u2018Art of Brilliance\u2019 SRO handbook, the Principles for Project Success, reissue of the Project Routemap series, development of the Government Project Delivery Framework and a range of other supporting guidance and tools.
