The ambitious level and coverage of the NLW have made it the flagship policy aimed at helping low-paid workers in the UK. In both the UK and internationally, there is broad consensus that minimum wages are effective at raising wages at the bottom of the distribution, as intended. But this compression of the wage distribution \u2013 commonly referred to as a reduction of \u2018pay differentials\u2019 between different jobs \u2013 may also create challenges for firms, above and beyond the direct cost implications of raising wages for the lowest paid.

We restrict our analysis to large firms because in the UK we only have survey data with wage information on a subset of firms\u2019 employees, meaning for small firms we cannot confidently measure their exposure. Still, our large firm sample covers 46 per cent of employees in the UK, with one fifth of these in firms that were heavily exposed to the NLW introduction (Panel A).",

Panel B is constructed in the exact same way as Panel A, but uses a sample of large firms with limited exposure to the NLW introduction, namely firms that employed less than 20 percent of their workforce below the 2016 NLW in 2015.

Second, this effect is more pronounced among heavily exposed firms. Third, following the introduction of the NLW, wage increases occurred not just at the level of the new minimum, but also up to two pounds above it. Thus, employers who employ significant numbers of minimum wage workers also raise the wages of some workers above the minimum. These \u201cwage spillovers\u201d mitigate the overall impact on pay differentials between jobs close to the bottom of the national wage distribution (though within low-wage firms these effects can stretch a long way up the within-firm wage distribution, as shown below). In additional analyses, we found that spillover effects tend to be larger among incumbent employees than among new hires, and larger in public or unionised firms. Some care should be taken inferring the exact size of the spillovers from these charts, since subsequent increases in the NLW between 2017 and 2019 mean the real distance between the current NLW and its 2016 level is positive rather than zero (although less than one).

In order to do this, we divide firms into four groups depending on the \u2018coverage\u2019 at the NLW introduction. Here, coverage measures the share of workers in a firm who were paid below the 2016 NLW in 2015. Table 1 shows the effect of the introduction of the NLW on the wage ratios of firms in each group, relative to the least exposed group of firms (those with less than 5 per cent coverage).",

This is because the majority of workers in the highly-exposed firms earn at or near to the minimum wage, and so there are limited differentials to be reduced. There is evidence of a fall in the 90-50 ratio for the moderately- and highly-exposed firms, showing that the effects can extend far up the wage distribution in firms with many minimum wage workers. It is an important reminder that, in those firms where many of the impacts of the NLW actually play out (i.e. highly-exposed firms), and whose reactions will matter most in shaping the impacts of the NLW, it is by no means merely a matter of bringing the very lowest-paid workers closer to the rest. These firms are typically responding to a shock much more substantial than that.",

We then use the share of employment in each of these occupation-wage groups as a proxy for the occupational structure of the firm. Figure 2 shows the association between the coverage of the 2016 NLW in 2015 and in the change in employment share from before to after the introduction of the NLW. We do not see significant differences, suggesting that the introduction of the NLW did not lead to any changes in firm structure by this measure. This does not rule out the possibility of more subtle changes \u2013 wage hierarchies are difficult to observe in survey data containing only a subset of employees, and the removal of grades on a pay scale may not show up in occupational changes in the data.",

It is hoped that these investigations will highlight areas where we can target our work. For example, we are working with LCSP to develop a river restoration project on the Waithe Beck in an area highlighted as a priority within the investigation.

The work was designed to take the River Aller back to a natural state from being a single thread channel to a system of multiple, cross-connected channels. This technique reconnects the river to its floodplain, helping to hold back floodwater during high flows and protect downstream communities. Groundwater levels are raised to store more water throughout the year. This helps the river become more resilient during times of prolonged dry weather and drought.",

The lack of gender consideration in my field partly results from the absence of research and evidence to generate meaningful guidance for gender-sensitive decision-making. This is further aggravated by the lack of diversity in the animal health workforce. When teams are composed of people from similar backgrounds, their perspectives are limited. This translates into policies, services and interventions that fail to be inclusive. Let me share with you some examples illustrating why gender matters in animal health.",
