The system is inherently environmentally challenging particularly as I lived in children\u2019s homes. I didn\u2019t want a foster family as I already had a family. At that time, children\u2019s homes were large institutions with around 15 bedded units with 15 children and young people with very different needs. Getting through the system was tough, but for me, it made me more determined to be someone and not a statistic or a stigma. This led to some very interesting experiences and at times down some very challenging roads. One of those roads was using solvents to escape from my emotions, mostly related to the death of my mother. Fortunately, as I approached 16 years of age, new roads emerged with better opportunities. One of which was meeting Alex, the manager of the last children\u2019s home I lived in.",

That\u2019s the approach he expected his staff to work to and most did. Working in that way removed the barriers of stigma and disadvantage within the home, but in the outside world that was a bigger challenge. One weekend when I had used solvents, I began to smash up the windows of the children\u2019s home and was taken to police cells overnight; my road to custody was almost sealed. The turning point was when Alex asked for me to be returned to the unit so he could discuss what had happened. I returned to the home, prepared to go into custody.\u00a0 Alex came into the office and said, \u2018you are going nowhere this is your home.\u2019 At that point that changed my whole life. I stopped using solvents and encouraged others to stop as well. Alex gave me another chance and the benefits of that is what led me to where I am today.",

The starting point when supporting young people who are care experienced is the fundamental question \u2018is what we offer good enough for my child or young person\u2019. Local authorities and partners are beginning to work more closely to develop bespoke offers for those who are care experienced. For example, Bolton have a dedicated housing worker in their leaving care team who prevents care leavers becoming homeless. Southend place their Department for Work and Pensions Single Point of Contact (SPOC) in the leaving care team. They engage care leavers who are nearing their 18th birthday in a conversation that starts with \u2018you are not claiming Universal Credit as I will find you work\u2019. Barking and Dagenham have an emotional wellbeing worker based in their leaving care team who supports the care experienced with emotional and mental health related issues. All of these roles are more than just roles in supporting those leaving care. They are based on trust and established relationships. These examples illustrate how the thinking is evolving to the mentality that \u2018this is what I would offer my child or young person\u2019.",
