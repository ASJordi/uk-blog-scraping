We undertake hydroacoustic monitoring surveys on larger waterbodies including in brackish water, in locations like the Norfolk Broads which are influenced by tides. Due to these factors, it is not possible to do electric fishing. The hydroacoustic monitoring gives slightly different and less specific information compared with an electric fishing survey, but it is still a very useful way for us to understand how many fish are present.\u00a0 This type of monitoring is done routinely on the relevant rivers all over East Anglia but I have worked on the river Yare, Bure, Waveney, Thurne, and Ant. We need warm water to do the monitoring as this is when fish distribution is consistent throughout the river. During the day fish often hide to avoid predators, so we undertake this work during the hours of darkness when fish come out into open water. Due to the shorter summer nights, we wait until autumn to do these surveys.",

Sometimes, you may choose to make a change to improve accessibility or decide to hold off on changes until more evidence is gathered. Both approaches are valid and should be documented accordingly.\nDocumenting design iterations in Figma is not only effective but also efficient as it eliminates the need to export designs to another tool. Everything stays within Figma, allowing you to add comments and insights directly on the design itself. This streamlines the process and ensures that all relevant information is easily accessible to the entire team.\nAdditionally, Figma offers flexible sharing options that enhance accessibility for team members without a Figma account. By setting the appropriate permissions, you can allow anyone with the link to view the file, ensuring that stakeholders and collaborators can access the designs without needing to create an account. For example, when a User Researcher recently joined the team, they were able to access and review all design iterations without needing a Figma account, understanding how research insights influenced design decisions.\nLucid\nIn Lucid, I developed a template specifically designed to document the iterative design process for each page of the service across multiple rounds of testing.\nHere\u2019s the structure I followed:\n\n\nDocument assumptions: Start by listing all the assumptions you want to validate through research.\n\n\nAdd page screenshots: Include a screenshot of the page you designed for reference.\n\n\nRecord research insights: Document what you learned from the first round of user research (UR), highlighting specific pain points uncovered, if any.\n\n\nNote design changes: Specify what you changed or did not change based on the research findings.\n\n\nExplain decisions: Clearly state why you made or did not make those changes.\n\n\nNew assumptions: Finally, jot down any new assumptions you want to validate in the next round of research.\n\n\nScreenshot of Lucid\n\nI adhered to this structure consistently throughout subsequent design versions, ensuring a clear and organised record of the design evolution.\nThis approach was especially useful because the service had multiple different journeys. By using Lucid, I could keep everything in one place\u2014the same board contained screenshots, research insights, and changes made from one version to another across all pages. Centralising all this information made it easy to track progress and maintain a holistic view of the design process for each journey.\nContrary to Figma, where files can be shared with anyone via a link, Lucid boards typically require users to have an account to access the content.\nConclusion\nDocumenting design iterations has proven to be invaluable in my work, not just for keeping track of decisions but for enhancing team collaboration and preserving the context of our designs. While the tools I\u2019ve used\u2014like Figma and Lucid\u2014have made this process more seamless, the key takeaway is that effective documentation should be tailored to your project\u2019s needs. Give it a try. You might be surprised at how much clarity and efficiency it brings to your design process.\n",
