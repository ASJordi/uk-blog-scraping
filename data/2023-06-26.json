We are fortunate to have had a long legacy of considering landscape in woodland creation going back at least fifty years to the seminal work of Dame Sylvia Crowe, and those principles refined and broadened are clearly set out in the UK Forest Standard. Like many in the Forestry Commission, I was introduced to this through one of Simon Bell\u2019s Woodland Design workshops back in 1997 and here I am today, 26 years later delivering those workshops. The workshops set out how applying UKFS guidelines and requirements to a site (through the Landscape Character Appraisal produced by Richard Hellier and myself and featured within our Woodland Creation Planning Guide) helps to champion integrated woodland design.",

Coined by the architect Frank Duffy, Pace Layers was originally an attempt to describe deterioration in the built environment, based on the premise that certain \u2018layers\u2019 (the structure, substrate) have longer life expectancies than others (the skin, the stuff inside). After Duffy, Stewart Brand contended that the relationship between differently-paced layers is \u201chow buildings learn after they\u2019re built\u201d [3].

For example, a rapid rather than gradual change in governance and order can bring about catastrophic revolution and disruption in the layers above. If nature is allowed to be driven at a commercial pace, we face the loss of \u201call-supporting\u201d resources (forests, fisheries etc), which sends destructive shockwaves through all other layers.\u00a0",

Global cooling at the start of the last glaciation allowed embryonic glaciers to form over high ground across Great Britain and Ireland. As conditions cooled, glaciers continued to grow, coalescing and flowing radially outwards, away from the mountains and across the lowlands and continental shelf to form the British-Irish Ice Sheet. Around 27,000 years ago, the ice sheet covered an area of 840,00 km2 and contained enough ice to raise global sea levels by 1.8 m(1).",
