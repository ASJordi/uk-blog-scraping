This February was the wettest on record, compared with last year which was the driest - and that has a massive effect on getting crops sown, growth rates and the success of the crop.

In general terms, there is no soil or crop need for nutrients during the autumn and winter months (though there are some exceptions).

Understanding how much rainfall you receive and rectifying issues with drainage and guttering can go a long way to reducing the volume of slurry you collect. As Tom notes, he was able to roof existing buildings with grant funding, meaning a lot of improvements made for little or no outlay, and a great deal of benefit to his storage capacity.\u00a0\u00a0",

Tom\u2019s slurry lagoon was a more significant financial investment but he is now reaping the benefits by buying in much less bagged fertiliser. As he mentions in the video, he is growing a lot more grass by applying slurry to his land at the right time. \u00a0",
