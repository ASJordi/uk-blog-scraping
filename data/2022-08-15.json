Female mosquitoes also require protein for egg production (termed oogenesis), they get this through consuming blood. Many pathogens have \u2018piggybacked\u2019 on this interaction to jump between hosts or to complete lifecycles. Therefore, when a female mosquito feeds on a vertebrate, unbeknownst to her, pathogens may indirectly be transmitted and ultimately cause disease.",

In my early career with HMIP I became site inspector for Sizewell B leading our regulation and permitting of the site which was in the final stages of construction and beginning commissioning. It was a hectic time, not least because of the outcome of a then ongoing judicial review for another site (Sellafield) meant that we had to consider \u201cregulatory justification\u201d in our decision making. As now, public consultation was important so we held a further consultation on regulatory justification. After carefully considering all the responses we received in our consultations we issued the \u201cauthorisations\u201d for the site in November 1994 \u2013 around 18 months after we received the applications.",

Likewise, I developed a natural way of communicating verbally because I wasn\u2019t able to rely on reading from scripts or referring to notes. I also find it hard to pick up on body language. Most leadership textbooks would have me believe this is a problem, but I find it means I pay absolute attention to the things people say and, perhaps more importantly, the things they are not saying.
