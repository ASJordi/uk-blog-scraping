There have been some notable changes in how falconry is practised in this country over time. At one stage it was practised almost exclusively by the nobility, often on horseback, and targeting a different range of quarry species to that of present-day falconers. By the 18th century, the popularity of falconry amongst the nobility had declined, as it was increasingly forced to compete with sport shooting. These days, falconry has a wider following, and in increasing numbers, though the core aspect of hunting using a trained bird of prey remains essentially unchanged.",
