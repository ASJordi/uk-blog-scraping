The tool considers chemical, biological, physical and socio-economic hazards along different stages of the food value chain, across all food sectors. This allows the relative risk of hazards to be compared, actively embracing trade-offs and, in doing so, facilitating collective decisions on priority interventions.",

Both One Food and the Multi-Hazard Dashboard are targeting ambitious goals and the group exchanged insights on challenges, successes, and best practices, focusing on optimising synergies between the initiatives as a means to address the complex interconnections between food, ecosystems, climate change and society.",
