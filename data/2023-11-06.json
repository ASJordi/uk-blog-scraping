After completing my BSc in Medical Biochemistry and MSc in Toxicology, I realised that I wasn\u2019t suited to life in a laboratory (for some reason, I would always have something go awry in my experiments)! I learned about clinical research and was immediately drawn to wanting to make a difference and help patients receive lifesaving/changing medicine. I started as a clinical research associate (CRA) in the pharmaceutical industry in 2008, progressing to a quality compliance role, then quality assurance as an auditor.

I have been at the MHRA for 17 years so I have seen plenty of changes in the world of clinical trials since I joined in 2006 shortly after the introduction of the Medicines for Human Use Regulations in 2004. I initially qualified from university as a Biomedical Scientist but fell into the world of hospital pharmacy where I initially trained as a pharmacy technician; once qualified I moved into aseptic manufacture within the NHS followed a few years later by commencing training to become a Qualified Person (QP) within the NHS. This led to a role in clinical trials as I gained broader skills to support my QP training. At this time the clinical trial regulations and the conduct of clinical trials were very different than they are today and eventually I ended up leading the provision of pharmacy clinical trial services within my NHS Trust. In 2006 I was encouraged to apply for a GCP Inspector\u2019s post by my manager and I admit to applying so that I could cross it off the list when I didn\u2019t get it and continue down the path to becoming a QP. Following the selection process I was offered the job and it was a significant turning point in my life as it meant leaving the NHS and becoming a civil servant and starting a life \u2018on the road\u2019.",

It\u2019s a vertical learning curve when you start life as a new inspector and it remains steep thereafter but it\u2019s always interesting and challenging. Once qualified there are multiple directions that you can take whether that\u2019s developing additional technical skills within a particular area, cross-training with another inspection team or developing management skills. I have done all of these and I continue to enjoy it every step of the way.

Secondly, the exposure I get, whether this is on inspection itself and seeing how different companies approach achieving compliance with regulations; training and presenting in front of large audiences; to speaking with other regulators and inputting to discussions on behalf of the MHRA; to imparting knowledge and experience with others, whether trainee inspectors or other departments. Above all the work is always diverse and stimulating.

When I was choosing what to study at university, I was undecided between food science and chemistry. However, on a trip to Leeds University (where I ended up studying) the chemistry department told me I should choose chemistry as it would give me more options.

Through a lot of hard work and collaboration with our group colleagues and stakeholders we were able to present progress in a variety of ways. For example, we can now show just how many buildings we\u2019ve demolished, how much fuel has been reprocessed, how much uranium has been produced, how much radioactive waste has been treated and how much land has been delicensed. From having vast amounts of information across our estate that uses different metrics and terminology, we\u2019ve been able to standardise units and language to tell a simpler, more consistent story.",
