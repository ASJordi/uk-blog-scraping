In my experience, failing to meet what I assumed was expected of me has left me feeling ashamed and despondent, although the very people I feel that I have let down may have been no worse for wear. This feeling could be caused by something big, such as a test result, down to something insignificantly small, such as being late to meet someone. Over time, without an outlet, these feelings can pile up, and in my experience the pressure can get to a point where you tangle yourself up in a quandary that I\u2019m sure many of us have experienced; the belief that failure can only occur if something is attempted, and a vicious cycle begins.",

Even for my own family in Beijing, whom I consider to be far more open on such topics than the average person, any discussion relating to issues like depression was always limited to whispered conversations between my older relatives.

Has someone lost the spring in their step? Maybe they\u2019re just tired, or maybe something is happening in their home life, the only way to know is to ask. Not being afraid to ask the question, not just about work, but also about the wellbeing of colleagues is an admirable trait to have, and one that I hope to practice and improve upon as I work in the industry. That one small question may seem insignificant to you, but to them it might be a lifeline out of a vicious cycle. For some people, pressures from family or culture may result in them lashing out at first. This doesn\u2019t mean that reaching out was a bad thing to do. Whilst mental health is no excuse for bad behaviour, consider the pressures they may be under, and how you could reach out and help them, as one day, the roles could be reversed.",

Issues relevant for example to housing policy may include community residents\u2019 experience of inequitable provision, property mismanagement and code violations. In addition to a capacity to act within such particular places, Carl argued for the capacity of design to make \u2013 for example, maps, data collections and visualisations. Thus, design can not only \u2018witness\u2019 but make concrete, enduring evidence of citizen experiences in ways that are directly relevant to policy.

He started by pointing out a common but outdated view of policymaking: a slow, linear and top-down process in which a decision-maker has a brilliant idea, which is then handed over to policymakers, then to others to implement, and finally to an evaluator. In contrast to this, he proposed five improvements within contemporary policy design.",

Provocatively, she pointed out that the turn to design may reveal some limits of policy \u2013 for example, limits to policymaking that is primarily technocratic and dominated by party politics. Our contemporary context is characterised by, in her words, \u201cradical uncertainty,\u201d in which there are high stakes and an urgency to act in relation to issues such as the pandemic and climate change. In this context, it\u2019s difficult to anticipate events, to predict how they will unfold, and to handle the plurality of legitimate views on how to proceed.

The point at which a material becomes an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or a medicine can differ depending upon what further processing steps there are. For example, cannabis flower/flos/bud could be a starting material, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or a finished product (i.e. a medicine) so your position in the manufacturing process is dependent on what happens next and not just what you do. This is because the regulatory framework sits around the product, not the process - so it is important that you understand where you, your activities, and your product fit relative to the finished medicine that the patient will receive.",

It tells us where people and objects are in relation to a particular geographic location whether in the air, on the ground, or at sea. So RPA maps around 2.6million land parcels \u2013 which we mean by fields \u2013 and we do this by using a range of intelligence such as notifications by the submission of an RLE1 form, Ordinance Survey and also through technology, and we use this to keep the mapping data as accurate as possible. When we process claims for payments we check this mapping data against the claim data we get from farmers and if there are any differences we have to resolve it. We also undertake an activity every year where we use aerial photography, satellite imagery and Ordnance Survey, which has been acquired that year, to check against any parcels that haven\u2019t been updated over three years. And so each year, we always have a mixture of zones across England and these are selected each year and digitisers compare the images to the claims we receive and our mapped land parcels and land covers. My team map physical land parcel boundaries and features, such as hedges, so accurate payments can be made to farmers.",

So, RPA currently receives over 20,000 RLE1 forms each year requesting mapping changes, and the majority of these are submitted during a two-month window from mid-April to mid-June, so a timely turnaround is reliant on farmers and land managers providing accurate information. This is also important as farmers need to ensure their digital maps correctly show agricultural land parcels on their holding so they\u2019re able to apply for, or claim, for rural payments. If the data on the RLE1 form is inaccurate or incomplete, or maps are incorrect or go missing, this can lead to mapping change delays.",
