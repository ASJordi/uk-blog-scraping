Fisheries in Namibia are very important for food security (especially protein), trade and commerce; they support many livelihoods in the extremely dry, coastal regions of the country, often providing jobs where limited alternatives may be available. Commercial fishing is mainly dependent on hake, horse mackerel, monkfish, rock lobster and crab. Fisheries in Namibia are mostly large-scale due to the harsh and arid coastal environment, but locally, small-scale artisanal fisheries do exist and all sectors are affected by climate change. Climate change is also affecting weather, currents and storminess, and therefore the safety and effectiveness of fishing. The new paper asks some really important questions: What are the key risks from climate change to Namibia\u2019s various fisheries sectors \u2013 including recreational and small-scale (artisanal) fisheries \u2013 and how could fisheries \u2018adapt\u2019 to climate change?",

This is perhaps unsurprising as Namibian rock lobster is very temperature-sensitive, and vulnerable to low oxygen levels in the water. The second most at-risk is the small-scale (artisanal) sector. This was an important finding, as most small-scale fishers are from marginalised communities, sometimes impoverished and with limited access to marine resources \u2013 in some cases even displaced from direct access to the coastline (as is the case with the Topnaar community, also investigated under One Ocean Hub).

For the rock lobster fishery, adaptation options included temporarily switching to other species such as snoek and hake, and importing lobsters for local processing when stocks are low. For small-scale fisheries, adaptation approaches included promoting inclusion and securing the livelihoods of small-scale fishing communities to counter marginalisation, by recognising small-scale fisheries as a sector and allocating exclusive fishing areas to reduce competition with the recreational sector. In terms of recreational activities, providing more desert tours and non-consumptive marine tourism activities might be a better alternative to angling. However, going forward, much more evidence and policy support will be needed to ensure that climate adaptation is integrated into day-to-day decision making on the marine environment.

In April our breeding seabirds, including terns, undertake the long migration from West Africa in the hunt for suitable shingle areas to nest. Shingle \u2013 made up of small, rounded pebbles and rocks - makes an ideal nesting habitat for terns, and other breeding seabirds, as they can create scrapes in the stones to lay their eggs which are then camouflaged by the pebbles. However, around the UK coastline suitable natural shingle habitat is in decline as a result of multiple factors, including sea level rise, increasing tidal surges and disturbance. This means that in the Solent there are only a handful of places left where our seabirds can successfully nest and raise a chick without the risk of being disturbed.
