The purpose of the breeding programme is to produce juvenile hen harriers for release into the arable landscape of Wiltshire, with the aim of creating a sustainable population in southern England. In continental Europe, hen harriers now largely nest in cereals which provide the tall dense structure that is necessary for concealing and protecting the nest. Similarly, Southern England could provide hen harriers with suitable nesting sites in cereal or other dense vegetation and vast areas to forage for food.\u00a0\u00a0",

For example, not long after the Gallery was built we used it to present lived experience research to understand land management in England through a project-specific micro-site (see image below). We rendered audio clips, stories and animations in an attractive magazine layout rather than a static report to bring to life and make engaging, complex case studies. This approach is adaptable and extensible and has generated significant interest from policymakers across government and was well received when demonstrated at the ministerial level.
