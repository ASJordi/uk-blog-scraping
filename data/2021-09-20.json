We do this both at the strategic level - advising local planning authorities on their spatial plans for future development - and at the site-specific level - advising on individual development proposals at pre-application and application stage. The Environment Agency has found that for every pound it has invested in providing spatial planning advice, around 12 pounds of flood damages have been avoided.",

Predictions also show that by 2050 we could see 59% more winter rainfall and once-a-century sea level events could become annual events by 2100.

Of those cases where we also recorded the local planning authority decision, over 97% of them were decided in line with our advice. This advice helped prevent around 30,000 homes being allowed in the floodplain in a potentially unsafe or inappropriate way. But we cannot be complacent. As a nation there is still more we can do to avoid the misery and damage from flooding associated with inappropriate new development built in the floodplain. For example, we are aware in 2020-21 that at least 600 homes were granted planning permission against our flood risk advice. We would like that number to be zero.",

The redesign ensures that new buildings are resilient to flooding whilst also creating a better local environment for businesses and community to enjoy. It is an example of the value the Environment Agency can bring to the design of more resilient and beautiful places through our role in the planning process.",

The register will also contain information about who owns the site and it will enable such sites to be traced back to the individual development whose BNG requirement they are helping to fulfil. The register will play a key role in minimising the risk of \u2018gaming\u2019 the BNG system by ensuring that the same parcel of land cannot be claimed as the means for delivering BNG by multiple developments. It will also ensure that there is a transparent, public record setting out what existed on the site before its use to deliver BNG and what the site biodiversity outcome the site is supposed to deliver.

Natural England, working with Government, has commissioned a study to help shape what a future monitoring and evaluation framework for BNG should consist of and how we can ensure approaches are adapted as we gather more evidence over the long term. Between now and the commencement of the mandatory BNG requirement we will be working with colleagues across Government to implement this macro-level monitoring and evaluation framework.",

It is vitally important that habitats are managed and maintained for the duration of the BNG agreement and that, if necessary, corrective measures are implemented if the BNG outcomes forecast through the metric are not forthcoming. None of us wants to see an outcome that looks good in the metrics calculation but then fails to materialise on the ground. Habitat enhanced or created to achieve BNG must achieve the distinctiveness and condition forecast and be managed and maintained over the long-term to benefit wildlife. Currently many habitat plans only consider what is needed over a 5-10-year period. BNG requires habitats be secured for at least 30 years, which means they must be managed and monitored. Adaptive management techniques may be needed to help facilitate this combined with periodic reporting of the habitat outcomes that enable corrective or enforcement (in extremis) action to be undertaken. Natural England will work with key stakeholders to develop a long-term habitat management and reporting plan for use in BNG.",
