We collected samples from the migratory birds and isolated the Salmonella bacteria. Then, using gold-standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods, we found that several of these Salmonella isolates were multi-drug resistant (multi-drug resistant Salmonella has been associated with more serious disease in people). We also found that some of the Salmonella isolates were resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and this was an important finding because the World Health Organisation classifies ciprofloxacin resistant Salmonella as a priority pathogen.",

This involves wading in a river, agitating the bed (with your foot sometimes, hence the name!) and taking samples. Invertebrate kick samples are particularly important as they can give us a clear picture of water quality without the need for chemical sampling.\u00a0 This is because certain invertebrates can only survive in specific water types - for example mayfly nymphs are only found in highly oxygenated, unpolluted rivers or streams. All this data feeds into national programmes, such as the Water Framework Directive, and plays a vital role in determining the state of our waters.",

Next month, aboard the RV Cefas Endeavour, our intrepid survey scientists will revisit the site to test this new approach . If successful, it will provide a new approach to collecting data on reef condition and therefore improve the quality of monitoring data from Wight Barfleur Reef. \u00a0It will also be a new milestone in the \u00a0moving beyond \u2018baselining\u2019 to collect a second set of data in the time series that will be used to compare the effectiveness of the MPA over time.",

However, reflecting on our journey so far has set our direction. Going forward, our MPA monitoring work will include working more closely across different organisations and disciplines within Cefas. We are also keen to partner with other types of survey (e.g. Highly Protected Marine Areas, Marine Natural Capital, and fish stock surveys) on the RV Cefas Endeavour to improve our understanding of wider ecosystem dynamics and challenges, as well as realising cost benefits and efficiencies. Collecting the highest possible quality data will be vital to ensure MPA management is fit for purpose. This \u00a0will be important not just to hit the 30 by30 target, but to ensure our MPAs are thriving in the years to come.",
