It\u2019s nearly 4 years since we commenced work on the Impacts and Adaptation Report of which I was a \u2018Coordinating Lead Author\u2019, jointly leading a terrific international team in writing the Terrestrial and Freshwater Ecosystems chapter.

The IPCC reports were one of many subjects of discussion but play a critical role in the UNFCCC processes.

The Loss and Damage fund which was established, will go beyond this recognising that some adverse impacts of climate change can\u2019t be prevented by adaptation and that the countries who are suffering most are often those who have emitted the least greenhouse gases. Recent examples, such as the floods in Pakistan and Nigeria, drought in East Africa and the impacts of rising sea levels on low-lying islands, featured prominently in many speeches and discussions at the COP. Agreement to establish a fund to address this is a massive step forward in the eyes of the most vulnerable and least developed countries, albeit that a lot of details need to be worked out, not least how big the fund should be and how much different nations will contribute.",

This featured prominently in our IPCC report and was what I talked about. The evidence base has developed substantially over the last 10 years. A key message is that we need to protect existing natural ecosystems and restore damaged and degraded ones on a large scale. This is important for reducing emissions, but also for making habitats and species populations more resilient. Healthy natural ecosystems can also reduce risks to people from, for example, floods, droughts and rising sea level. COP decisions recognised the importance of protecting and restoring nature and for the first time the official text explicitly encouraged countries to consider using \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019. It is also however clear that NBS can be badly implemented and need to be based on good scientific and practical understanding, respecting the needs and rights of local and Indigenous communities.",

Consequently, policy designers work to a triple-bottom line that seeks to understand and make trade-offs against 3 bases: intent (what elected representatives and leading officials want to change in the world), systems (the environment that the policy or service will need to survive and thrive within, including finance, legal, process, stakeholders), and citizens (what do the public need and what will they respond to).",

This ensures the investment choices that we make as a nation are of the highest quality possible and that they maximise public value and give citizens meaningful outcomes.

The headline, high cost of public policy and services that fail should also be noted (for a list of failures that were made without design expertise see\u00a0The Blunders of Our Governments). The weakest initial policy ideas are often based on assumption and bias.

They are an important source of jobs too, directly employing over 30,000 and contributing more than \u00a32billion to our economy every year.

So I am delighted to mark the beginning of National Tree Week 2022 with a major \u00a320million funding package, made possible through our landmark Nature for Climate Fund. Over 100 projects championed by tree nurseries, charities and businesses will be funded to bring the latest innovations to the forestry sector and address some of the greatest threats facing our treescapes. Local authorities across the country will receive significant funding to kickstart tree planting activity, create new green jobs and boost access to nature.
