Are people who talk about \u2018policy design\u2019 all talking about the same thing? Is \u2018design\u2019 a helpful concept when considering the messy reality of political process? Is there enough space in policy systems and practices to effectively enable the radical cultural changes we need to arrive at more sustainable ways of living? These were some of the challenging questions posed by the \u2018provocateurs\u2019 at the first meeting of the AHRC Design and Policy Network. With around 20 in-person and 30 online participants, comprising a mix of academics, civil servants, and designers, this inaugural conversation explored the \u2018tensions and resistances\u2019 in the contemporary field of design and policy.",

The three speakers, embodying perspectives from policy practice, political science and design, then shared what they saw as the key challenges for the field.",

He suggested there will always be a gap \u2013 not solvable by \u2018design\u2019 \u2013 between an idealised centralised process and what is accepted as \u2018good enough\u2019 in a decentralised process.
