Not only that, it ensures that new developments are more resilient to the effects of heat, drought and flooding, placing less of a strain on water supplies. Indeed, with strategic planning we can take advantage of the many synergies available, accelerating new, greener developments with multiple benefits for people and wildlife, at the same time as directing finance to where it will have the greatest impact for the natural world.",

It will mean shaping the emerging Local Nature Recovery Strategies to achieve local EIP delivery.
