There were 551,000 more moves into inactivity from better-paying occupations in 2019-2022 than in 2016-2019, but only 11,000 more from low-paying occupations. This chimes with the IFS analysis, which suggests that increased retirement is a key driver of increased movements into inactivity amongst older workers. [2] We would expect workers in better-paying occupations to be more likely to decide to retire as they are more likely to have the pensions and other savings necessary to make that decision. University of Essex researchers found that moves into inactivity amongst older workers increased most for those with mid-level hourly pay [6].",

During the last three years, fewer people moved into low-paying occupations from inactivity. Low-paying occupations are more likely to require interpersonal interactions, so the reluctance of workers to move into these occupations could reflect continued health concerns. Barrero et al. (2022) [7] document evidence that \u201clong social distancing\u201d in the US is reducing the employment rate by up to 2 percentage points. They find that it disproportionately affects low-paid jobs which involve interpersonal interactions. It is possible a similar trend is affecting employment in the UK.",

The net movements (movements in minus movements out) into low-paying occupations from better-paying occupations decreased by 73,000 in 2019-2022 relative to the previous three-year period. This may reflect more workers moving into better-paying occupations to backfill the half a million additional workers who moved into inactivity. In our consultations over the last two years, employers have told us that many workers were moving out of occupations such as hospitality which require evening and weekend work to other jobs with more convenient hours.",
