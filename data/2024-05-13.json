As a result of the exemption, these regulations do not receive the same, independent scrutiny of the quality of the impact, or options assessments as other Government regulatory proposals. A recent report on regulation from the Centre for Policy Studies criticises a DLUHC regulation requiring a second staircase in buildings that are more than 18m tall. They comment that DLUHC\u2019s estimate of the cost of the measure: \u201cappears to be out by an order of magnitude. Yet there is no way for anyone outside DLUHC to challenge the figures, not least because the new Better Regulation Framework exempts \u2018regulatory provisions for the safety of tenants, residents and occupants in buildings\u2019 from independent scrutiny\u201d.",
