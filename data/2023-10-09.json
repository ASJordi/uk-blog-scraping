High Level Waste is more radioactive to the point where it generates its own heat and is generally in the form of spent nuclear fuel and vitrified high active waste (HLW is only a relatively small volume of waste at Sellafield). \u00a0That is why High Level Wastes and some Intermediate Level Wastes can only ever be disposed of in a GDF.",
