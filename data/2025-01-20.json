Amongst other papers, I found a CQC special study on hospital discharge from 2004, the 2008 End of Life Care strategy (another hot topic as the Assisted Dying Bill progresses) and from 2009, a vision to reform our care and support system to establish a National Care Service.\u00a0 Perhaps it is not that things don\u2019t change, rather that knotty challenges take thoughtful, long-term and consistent work to achieve change.",

The Marine Management Organisation is watching how the fishery unfolds to see if special regulations need to be put in place. As it will be an additional pressure on the existing scallop stock it is imperative that the new King Scallop Fisheries Management Plan incorporates this mode of fishing into its long-term vision for more sustainable scallop fisheries.
