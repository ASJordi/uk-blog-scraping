Government set us a unique challenge to establish a working scheme within eight months from scratch. I\u2019d like to sincerely thank the amazing Natural England team leading this work as well as the long list of partners and stakeholders who have supported us and enabled us to rapidly to set up a scheme that we can all have confidence in. Defra and DLUHC are investing up to \u00a330 million to fast track the delivery of nutrient mitigation in affected areas through, for example, creating new wetlands to 'soak up\u2019 or mitigate the impacts of unavoidable nutrient pollution.",

The range and roles available within government science are not always visible, so we aim to break down barriers to accessing relevant information and enable true social mobility. To achieve these goals, the SMWG would like to start information exchanges, support, and mentorship to members of the profession. So far, our members have identified they would like to take part in school outreach and raising awareness of entry to further education schemes as attainable goals to champion. We would also like to send regular guides, links to training and mentorship through our newsletters and group support meetings.",
