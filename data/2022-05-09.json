Or have you wondered what to do with the unwanted contents of a garden pond? \u00a0Studies have shown a higher likelihood of non-native and/or ornamental aquatic species being found in waters near fairground sites and garden centres as a result of the animals being released when no longer wanted. Ornamental fish species such as koi carp have been introduced into commercial fisheries often bringing with them the risk of koi herpes virus, a disease that affects common carp, causing losses and an economic impact to fisheries. Even releasing the wrong animal or plant into your garden pond could start an unwanted invasion if they can spread from there into the wider countryside, for example in the event of a flood which connects your pond to a nearby river. Elsewhere, invasive species such as lionfish are damaging coral reef fish communities across the Caribbean following the first report of them off Florida in the 1980s, and the species is now becoming established in the Mediterranean as well.",

These notifiable animal diseases must be reported to APHA. Typically, the NEEG is mobilised once a notifiable disease has been identified by our diagnostic team and confirmed at a disease confirmation teleconference led by the UK\u2019s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) or the CVO for Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (depending on the where the outbreak is). One of the strengths of the NEEG is that it can also be mobilised before disease is confirmed, if there is a strong suspicion of a notifiable disease. This significantly increases the speed of the disease investigation, especially the gathering of potential source and spread tracings, which are key to disease control.",

Once the young harriers taken into captivity have fledged, they are released back into the wild, with the same number of birds being released into the same broad areas of upland habitat that chicks were taken from.",
