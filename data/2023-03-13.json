Brood management involves taking the eggs or chicks of some Hen Harriers nesting on grouse moors into captivity, rearing them to fledging age, and releasing them back into the wild in the uplands of northern England. This reduces the density of active Hen Harrier nests on grouse moors and is thought to reduce predation pressure on red grouse during the breeding season. In theory, this should lead to changes in some of the negative perceptions and behaviours within moorland communities and reduce illegal persecution of Hen Harriers. Illegal persecution is the main threat to the recovery of this iconic and at-risk species in England, and Natural England is committed to working with partners to tackle this \u2013 see previous blogs for further details.",

The availability of brood management should change attitudes of grouse moor managers by reducing the perceived threat of nesting hen harriers to grouse shooting interests. This should result in lower levels of persecution, leading to increasing survival rates of hen harriers (measured by satellite tracking) and finally to increasing numbers of hen harrier nests. The trial aimed to measure changes in all of these things, compared to before the introduction of brood management. The trial was also intended to practically test the methods, and impact on the birds, of taking, captive-rearing and releasing hen harrier chicks, as this had not been done before in the UK.",

This has focused on delivering flood warnings to those properties which pose challenges for traditional river monitoring and forecasting approaches. This might be due to a rural location; a lack of nearby power supply; inadequate ground conditions for a traditional monitoring station; or if the river is too small to be routinely monitored. New approaches were developed that were suitable for these locations \u2013 they are smaller; can be attached to bridges and other structures; are quick and simple to install and run off solar power. Essentially, they reduce the complexity and cost of installation and can be rolled out quickly. More than 180 communities have benefited from this new approach and many more will in the future.",

In an attempt to manage fishing within these areas, countries with fishing interests in a geographical area come together to form Regional Fisheries Management Organizations and Administrations (RFMO/As). Most RFMOs have management powers to set catch and fishing effort limits, technical measures, and control obligations in an attempt to regulate fishing activities in areas of the high seas.\u00a0\u00a0",

Scientists from Cefas have been working with the RFMO for the Northwest Atlantic (NAFO) to create and apply an ecosystem approach since 2009.\u00a0 The ecosystem approach considers nature as a system and looks at everything as interconnected and interdependent. We don't just focus on a single species or a single problem, but we try to understand how all the different pieces fit together. For example, a change in one part of the ecosystem can have a big impact on everything else. One of the guiding principles of the recent NAFO approach is that the total catches at the ecosystem level should not exceed the rate at which the ecosystem can regenerate. This is known as the Total Catch Index (TCI). By taking the ecosystem approach, NAFO are working to ensure that fish stocks are sustained, that vulnerable marine species and habitats are protected, and ecosystem overfishing is prevented.\u00a0\u00a0",

The Cefas team, along with colleagues from other NAFO member countries, have worked together to develop ways to understand and calculate the loss of biodiversity caused by bottom trawling activities (scs20-23 WG-ESA Report Nov 2020 (nafo.int)). This scientific evidence has supported the closure of all seamounts to bottom fishing activities at fishable depths in the Northwest Atlantic and protecting over 90% of the sponge biomass located within the NAFO Regulatory Area subject to fishing activity. \u00a0",
