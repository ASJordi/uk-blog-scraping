Mrs Thatcher\u2019s determined support for Zircon in the face of wider opposition on cost grounds is testament to her advocacy of intelligence, something perhaps reinforced by her visits.

In some cases the property address was replaced by that of the energy assessor submitting the certificate, but in others with a different address entirely. Each of these mismatched addresses was replicated across many assessments. The new register service is based on the addresses recorded in the XML data, which meant that searching for certain postcodes returned a list of over 4,000 EPCs.

This is mainly due to cooler-than-average sea temperatures because these corals grow deeper than usual for tropical reefs. Some reef areas were found to stretch from 30 m to 75 m depth, meaning they have been relatively sheltered from thermal stress. For this same reason, it is likely that the corals of the Pitcairn Islands will continue to elude severe bleaching for longer than other tropical reefs. However, the report also notes that these corals remain at risk from several other factors, including:",
