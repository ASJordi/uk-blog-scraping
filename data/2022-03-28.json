By having a common platform, it means that we've got a standard approach to providing the hosting platform and the tooling that goes along with that. So we build the platform once and it's there as an easily consumable resource for feature teams. So we can remove the cognitive load from the feature teams of building platforms. And the platform was built by the expert team and push of a button, the platform can be there, the common tooling can be there. And that enables the line of business teams and the feature teams to focus, where they should be focusing on is building new features. Dean can talk a little bit about how we've done that and the technologies and tooling that we've got in the common platform, Dean?",

So we've got infrastructure as code, we've got software defined networks, we can quickly see how the environment is going to be composed. And that is our source of truth. Nothing can differ from that in the environment, we'll make sure that it always sticks to that, what is in the Git repo.
