It measures the functional diversity in the plankton community, through examining the abundance of groups of plankton that share a similar functional role within their environment. By assessing plankton as functional groups, rather than as individual species, we can identify important changes which can impact other components of the food web. This indicator has been used to assess pelagic habitat biodiversity status at the UK and OSPAR levels, and the outputs can help scientists and policymakers further their understanding of how the marine food web is changing in response to human pressures.",

Modern government in a globalised world is highly complex. Successive governments of different colours, the Post Office board, non-executives, company representatives, civil servants and others failed to respond to the growing wave of concerns raised by Sub Post Masters. In a world where data is king, it seems unfathomable that patterns of problems in the system were not surfaced or seen. Concerns were raised with MPs, with departments, with ministers and in the media. And more was known internally both at Fujitsu and the Post Office at the time.\n\nIn 2013, the government clarified that the Nolan Principles apply to all those who deliver services on behalf of the taxpayer. This means that anyone taking decisions or providing services using public funds must live up to them. \u00a0CSPL\u2019s reports in 2014 and 2018 on ethical standards for providers of public services commented on the lack of consistent structures or arrangements in place to actively promote the right culture or behaviours.\n\nThe Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry got underway in 2020; this statutory public inquiry is left untangling the web of accountability that left Sub Post Masters with the blame at such terrible personal cost. This inquiry is one of 13 other statutory inquiries currently taking place across the UK. It is the Inquiry\u2019s job to look at what happened and determine culpability.\u00a0 But after what has been termed the greatest miscarriage of justice in British history, it has taken a high-profile drama to bring the political activity and action required.\n\nHow can we prevent this type of overall systems and standards failure happening again? And looking further ahead, how do we ensure the important Nolan principle of accountability is \u2018built in\u2019 to the opportunities and complexities that new technology like AI will bring?\u00a0 A lot of the answers exist already, and they are not technical.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s report Leading in Practice emphasised the importance of organisational culture including creating routes for people to speak up and safeguards for those who choose to raise concerns:\n\n\u201cOrganisational policies and schemes alone are not enough. Creating a \u2018speak up\u2019 culture requires leaders to listen with curiosity and appreciation, to take action where appropriate, and to provide feedback on the outcome. Leadership in this area requires a proactive approach, creating a range of informal and formal opportunities to listen to employees, and an ongoing commitment to building a culture where people are encouraged to speak up and are comfortable doing so.\u201d\n\nThere is little point speaking up if those with the power to act fail to listen. What happened at the Post Office begs questions about the culture and relationships that stood in the way of these issues being brought forward and resolved before so many Sub Post Masters and their families suffered so much.\n\nThere is such a lot to learn from this terrible scandal. Not least that high standards require vigilance and leadership. They do not happen by accident.",

Soon after my visit that young eagle left the nest and is now living in the wild. One day, in a few year\u2019s time I hope to hear that it is attending a nest of its own. That one bird summed up for me the progress that is being made: practical, real, inspiring, and achieved via partnership working among committed and effective people.
