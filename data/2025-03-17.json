I find it really interesting the impact a single change could have had on the outcome of the operation, for example, the weather. For instance, if it was poor weather meaning no allied air support, then the Germans could have completely stopped the Canadian and British armies. The other game is the\u00a0Counterinsurgency series on Cyprus. For a similar reason, it's a point of history I don't know as much about but being able to identify some of those core principles of counterinsurgency and how you can enact them, in a hobby environment, is really fascinating.
