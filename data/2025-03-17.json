Equally, we're also seeing a greater level of interest outside of Defence, particularly in business wargaming.\u00a0I think the expansion beyond the Defence field is probably one of the biggest trends I've seen in the last few years.",

The first is\u00a0Operation Overlord Normandy\u00a0because I\u2019ve spent hours playing it with friends. I find it really interesting the impact a single change could have had on the outcome of the operation, for example, the weather. For instance, if it was poor weather meaning no allied air support, then the Germans could have completely stopped the Canadian and British armies. The other game is the\u00a0Counterinsurgency series on Cyprus. For a similar reason, it's a point of history I don't know as much about but being able to identify some of those core principles of counterinsurgency and how you can enact them, in a hobby environment, is really fascinating. It adds an extra level of enjoyment to be able to go \u2018oh, OK, this is why this stuff happens\u2019.\u00a0",
