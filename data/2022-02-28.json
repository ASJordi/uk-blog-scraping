Natural mortality is high for juvenile hen harriers, especially in winter, and natural causes of death include predation, starvation and disease. However, illegal persecution on land managed for grouse shooting remains the main threat to the recovery of hen harriers, and Natural England research has found high rates of tag failure on grouse moors.

If a dead bird is retrieved, a post-mortem examination is carried out, normally by our partners at the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London (ZSL).

At the time, ground-breaking work by ZSL and Natural England confirmed that Betty was shot, using electron microscope techniques to show that metal had been propelled into her leg, and to detect the composition of metallic residues undetected by conventional x-rays. Whilst this proved Betty was shot, the leg injury was not thought to have been immediately fatal. It is thought that Betty could have flown to her last known location, and the location where she was shot is still unknown.",

Being a scrum master myself on the ground, and then going into a space now where I lead multiple teams is a very interesting space. And I've had the joys of having teams and work with other people in different capacities that are either very understanding of how agile is a tool and a framework in which we used to deliver. And also those that are zealots and they they pray to the God of agile. And so it's a very complicated space. And in government, we have all the fun of trying to implement agile in an effective way that's meaningful and honest and effective.

They've gone to university, they've studied agile delivery, and they've come out of university, work with us, and they only ever know agile delivery.

But having cross functional teams, where you perhaps got people from policy involved, where you've got your business stakeholders embedded in the team. That is something that worked really well. And those projects tend to work better. Because you're not then building something where you have to go and present it out to some external body and say, \u201cIs this what you wanted?

So all the things you can imagine that exist in DWP, and also highly regulated by the government because they\u2019re an insurance company, it's not the same thing. One of the differences I think was there that stood out quite significantly coming into DWP is that the same issues existed. I think what private sector I think does a better job of doing as they also got to the point where enough was enough. And that came really hard and fast. And that was a bit surprising I think for lots of people involved. For instance, they went years back and forth about how to implement agile, they created their own department specifically for agile, to kind of test and try it out to kind of get the culture there. They had all versions of it and then eventually got to a point that said we are a digital organisation, we are going to go this specific direction. If you like it, either like it or lump it, here are options, you will need to apply for your job, you will need to get certified in areas and they took a no holds barred approach to getting it done.

But also they did take a very hard line at points. And it wasn't at all that it was lost in negotiation and complexity politics, with big Ps and little Ps, that they had to work through to get that done. But there did become a point that said our cost value is actually we get more of a benefit of doing X over Y. And I think I saw a lot more of that in private sector of sometimes slowly getting there. But eventually getting there and looking at the actual return on investment to understand what was the ROI for making decision X over Y, and sometimes making very difficult decisions, even in moving the culture quite rapidly towards what needed to go.

That was something I had to get my head around coming into public as GDS doesn't exist as a thing out in private sector. Some organisations are adopting it, some don't.

So whereas in the private sector, there are lots of opportunities to make changes very quickly, and you know, a big process can change and you can implement it within weeks, that just isn't possible on a large scale within DWP. So I think that can sort of be very frustrating and knowing that it can't change overnight. And we have, I would say, much more stricter processes and hierarchy to manage that culture change.

And although that was a big operational hit, in digital it's almost like we didn't blink. \u00a0I'm sure loads of people were scrambling around doing tonnes of work to add on 50% of their customer base over the course of week. But we've designed for that. And I think we've designed for being very flexible. We moved to remote working very easily. We can stand up services. When Ministers get a new idea or you get a change of government or change of minister and they come in with some new ideas, we're really good at standing things up quick.

I think the only consistent thing that there should be is that we're delivering value and we're doing it for a reasonable cost. What we believe in in DWP throughout the many hundreds of teams that we've got working on all sorts of different products and services, is that the teams are empowered to determine their own ways of working, that they're held accountable once they've been empowered for solving a problem.

And although I think that might sort of be true if you're looking at specific frameworks, there's obviously be standards for those. I think it's different if you just think about agile delivery and our teams. So like, when I speak to my colleagues, you sort of realise that sort every team is unique. And being a delivery manager and DWP is about being able to adapt your approach to get the best out of those individuals and the unique way in which those people work together. And I think if the last two years of being in the Civil Service has taught me anything is that we're nothing without our people and sort of building a strong team that can collaborate effectively and with respect should be the priority for all of us, because I think it builds resilience against most of the things that we come up against when trying to deliver.",

And I think it's a double edged sword, which is really interesting process. I think of my specific role, coordinating multiple teams, having teams and you've got a mixture of agile delivery, whether it be the many frameworks they might be delivering, whether it be waterfall to any of the various agile ones. The complexity of that, plus having empowered teams plus being accountable to government and ministers.

And one of the complexities of most organisations is trying to figure out how do you fund agile teams. We're no different than anybody else, we're exactly in the right evolutionary space. Sure, we'd all like it to be better but it is where the industry is at the moment, and in the IT industry trying to figure out how you balance these teams.",

But also there is a need to lay out a bit of a path on how we do that. And that's not through, I think the current governance structures that existed pre agile implementation, it is looking at a new way which we operate. And I think that still deserves its own space to really understand. I think we've got lots of teams that are doing some amazing stuff. And they're using a mixture of all the various skills that we've all known in delivering projects, whether they be your waterfall, agile, new ways of doing agile, evolved agile ways of thinking. And I think it goes with that commitment that we get from a goal standard for me, if we were to use that term, and actually consider that would be that we effectively are able to deliver any product and any service and that's understood and supported from the top down. That our executives down to every member of the team knows and feels confident that they can deliver in a space where they feel safe, where they are productive, where what they're doing is meaningful, and that they're consistently getting stuff out the door.

And that requires a degree of coordination that we haven't really practised before. And it's only in the last two years - ironically, during the pandemic, the hardest time to coordinate - that we've had to really start focusing on that. And it's a skill gap I think that we have. And it\u2019s somewhere that we need people to step up and provide some of those things, scaling frameworks there's lots of them. If anything, there's too much choice. And obviously, some of them we all know, lean to that over dictation of how people work. And so we're still learning as an organisation how do we evolve, we can keep that team autonomy, and yet do the big stuff that requires many teams and some of our teams might have 20 teams working on a single area.

Because I think for me, it's really important that teams are able to work in a way that works for them in order to deliver. But in the same sense, what I think sometimes we lack if we've got lots of teams who are working on the same thing, is a real solid understanding of the why, as in are we all moving in the same direction? Are we all moving to the same thing? And being super clear about what part each team is playing on that, so you don't start to get a convergence of things. Like you said, Barry, we spend a lot of time in the user research space, which is great. But are we all trying to do the same thing? Are we all looking for the same answers?

In a multidisciplinary team, you know, the, you don't tell the tester how they should test, you don't tell the engineer how they should write code. Equally, the delivery manager brings their expertise in ways of working, and we should be prepared to say, \u201cHere's some really good ways of working. Everything we do we do as a team, but you know, I'm advancing my theory.\u201d And I think that translates into the organisation as well. We probably all need to step up a bit more. And when we see that gap, fill the gap. You know, we often say they won't let us do this, they made this rule. And it dawned on me one day that the they that's us. We're the people that make the rules, we all make the rules together. You know, and in delivery in particular, we're often setting rules, aren't we? We're focused on how things work, while the people who are actually doing the work, get on and do it. We're worried about those sorts of things like governance and stuff. We make the rules, so we should be able to step up.

The team are responsible for their own problems. Delivery is a team sport.

Have you got an environment where they can call out when they don't have that, when they don't feel that they're able to communicate or they're not able to raise issues?

This applies in particular to downer cows that do not respond to treatment, and the clinical history (changed behaviour, abnormal gait) may be indicative of a neurological disease or the animal is old enough to consider atypical BSE (usually 8 years of age or older).
