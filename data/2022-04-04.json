Here, I talked about the harrowing case of David Fuller who was convicted of murder and videoing his abuse of the victims. However, while his behaviour went against everything we see as right (as pointed out by the trial judge) it didn\u2019t breach any data protection rules because they only protect the dignity of the living. \u00a0The same was true of the egregious conduct by police officers who took pictures of two murder victims. To me these dreadful cases highlight how DP laws have not kept up with the potential intrusiveness of surveillance and why \u2018data compliance\u2019 is not always the same as acceptable surveillance behaviour.",
