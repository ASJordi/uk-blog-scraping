For instance: I contributed to a new data strategy for the department and coordinated an away day for all the data professions and portfolios. I also led a cross-government effort to improve the job description of data analysts in DDaT. Being given the opportunity to step so far outside my comfort zone is an invaluable feature of the EOI process. It also speaks to the quality of our leadership in DDaT. They are open to giving their staff a chance to grow and give them autonomy and trust to take on new responsibilities.\u00a0",
