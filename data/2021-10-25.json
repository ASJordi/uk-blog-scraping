There have been many reports in the media over the last 18 months about charities hit by increased demand, about others struggling to fund their services as restrictions were imposed, and, in a few cases, we\u2019ve heard of charities whose income sky-rocketed thanks to extraordinary fundraising efforts. These anecdotal accounts help us understand what the pandemic \u2018felt like\u2019 from the perspective of people involved in, and reliant on, individual charities. But as regulator, we needed more concrete data to help us understand how the pandemic has shaped charities so far, and, crucially, to gain a picture of the risks that may lie ahead. To that end, we undertook a project to assess the impacts of COVID-19. This involved interrogating the data we already hold \u2013 including through the annual return, through reports from auditors, whistleblowers and charities themselves, as well as existing research prepared by charity sector bodies. We also worked with our research partner Yonder to commission independent research looking at how charities of different sizes perceive the impact of the pandemic on their finances, governance and operations.",

The majority (60%) saw a loss of income, and a third (32%) said they experienced a shortage of volunteers. Given these findings, it is perhaps surprising that we haven\u2019t seen a significant number of charities fold since March 2021. Last year, 97 charities reported to us that they were insolvent, as part of their annual return to the Commission. That is up by a third on the previous year, but still a relatively small number when compared to the 170,000 charities on our register.\u00a0 Overall, the number of charities closing did not vary significantly compared to the previous year.",

Smaller charities were especially likely to have taken drastic measures to remain afloat or simply in response to the restrictions imposed early on in the pandemic. One in four charities with incomes of less than \u00a310k paused their activities completely during the first lockdown. It\u2019s also clear that government support, including the furlough scheme, helped bolster many charities\u2019 resilience.

It is also our experience that disputes between trustees are often at the heart of governance failures. We fear that will continue, to the detriment of charities\u2019 beneficiaries, and perhaps also to public trust in charities. But even in respect of relationships and governance, the picture is not all gloomy. Nearly half of those asked (49%) say their staff and/ or volunteers have learnt to make better use of digital technology over the past year or so, and a significant minority (18%) say communication between trustees has improved since the beginning of the pandemic.

As in other parts of society, we may be seeing a slow shift in the skills and attitudes required of those in leadership positions \u2013 certainly \u2018softer\u2019 skills around communication and co-operation may grow in importance in the months and years ahead. Because this is not the \u2018end\u2019.

Less predictable was the news report telling how a traffic enforcement camera had just mistaken a pedestrian in a knitted jumper for a car.\u00a0 Having decided that the word on the woman\u2019s sweater was a number plate, the camera system issued an immediate fine to the bewildered registered keeper of a vehicle hundreds of miles away for driving in a bus lane.\u00a0 His cherished plate is vaguely similar to the word \u201cknitter\u201d as displayed on the pedestrian\u2019s woollen jumper.\u00a0 While somehow farcically reassuring that the rise of the smart machine to replace us all is perhaps further off than some might think, this incident reminded us that, while human surveillance decision-making is approximately right, when the tech fails it\u2019s precisely wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 (This is also one of the 5 reasons why \u201cif you\u2019ve done nothing wrong you\u2019ve nothing to worry about\u201d is probably the poorest surveillance reassurance you can receive but back to the conference\u2026)",

It\u2019s an interesting one, particularly as I have no direct responsibility for this aspect of intrusive surveillance but the answer remains the same.\u00a0 As ever, it\u2019s the use and the user that are the key and we know from elsewhere in the world that this type of surveillance technology can be used in some very sinister ways under the banner of \u2018education\u2019.",

Is it a once-and-for-all choice or will it come round again in light of experience with the new technology? You can reverse out of many consumer decisions if you change your mind; can you in this case? What are the implications for your opted-out child standing in the dinner queue with their peers? \u00a0It\u2019s easy to see how tasks such as registration and attendance or safeguarding needs in schools would benefit from facial recognition capabilities but \u2018function creep\u2019 would mean you inevitably arrive at a point where the camera in the dining area can recognise who's playing Joseph in the nativity play.\u00a0 With the police your bargaining position may feel even less balanced.\u00a0 You also have to factor in the tech going wrong \u2013 sometimes in ways you hadn\u2019t predicted.",

The expansion in privately owned cameras has brought by a corresponding increase, not just in the sharing of stories but the sharing of images, with the police and other bodies, either of the citizen\u2019s own volition or in response to the now ubiquitous appeals for dashcam, GoPro, doorbell or other captures.\u00a0 When it needed a fallible human with a finite attention span to monitor and analyse it, all this newly-enabled aggregated surveillance data had limited practical use: there is simply too much of it.\u00a0 But advances in video analytics and systems for combining, categorising and editing these datasets now allow very significant uses of this new surveillance capability.\u00a0 Again, that\u2019s not a bad thing in itself: every day there are significant investigations of heinous criminality that have been greatly helped by this pooled technology and there will be many more ahead.",

When the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice was first published, the BSIA put the ratio of private to public cameras at 70:1;\u00a0 it is a reasonable hypothesis that this relative imbalance will have increased exponentially since.\u00a0 Security and intelligence journalist Philip Ingram led us through a fascinating presentation about the critical role that public space surveillance played in the investigation into the Novichok poisoning of UK citizens in Salisbury by Russian agents and spoke of Chinese cameras being installed around the country with \u2018hidden\u2019 latent functionality such as the ability to read number plates (and presumably our clothing).\u00a0 Against this background, the risks highlighted by the Foreign Secretary over the weekend about dependency within parts of our critical national infrastructure begin to move to closer to our high streets, our hospitals and our schools.",
