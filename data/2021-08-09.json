In addition, supplementary food was provided at a small number of nests in other habitats, to support nesting success. While this additional food is likely to have contributed to their success this year, we believe that more work to provide support and best practice advice will ensure that additional feeding is having the best possible effect on Hen Harrier breeding success.",

We are happy that this cohort have shown good survival rates and excellent recruitment into the breeding population, and are demonstrating successful breeding behaviour, thereby contributing to the increase in breeding Hen Harrier numbers.
