In my lessons, I focus on ensuring all children can see the structure of maths and I think carefully about what children will notice in a lesson.\u00a0 I also check in with the children during and after lessons to check their understanding and adapt my teaching appropriately. I start with the assumption that my children can learn this, so it\u2019s up to me to teach it in a way they understand.\u00a0 I no longer do three-part lesson where I show the children a procedure and expect them to remember and reproduce it.\u00a0 I no longer automatically use three levels of different tasks. My lessons now involve constant checking, looking out for and addressing misconceptions, and deepening learning through carefully designed questions. I also use practice activities that engage the children with thinking deeply about mathematics and encourage them to not rush through things in the hope of being the first one to finish. I always say to the children I teach, \u2018maths is never finished\u2019 and we should never stop learning about it.",

In order to achieve this, we place reading at the heart of our curriculum and have developed a clear and coherent whole school strategy for teaching the skills of reading and promoting reading for pleasure. Our reading culture is embedded across the school, with school staff acting as champions for reading. We weave reading into as many aspects of school life as possible. For example, our school houses are named after four inspirational authors/ poets: Coelho, Donaldson, Jeffers and Rauf. Children learn about these authors and explore their amazing work. We know that to support children to achieve outstanding outcomes in their reading we need to make a rapid start to teaching phonics when they join us in Reception. We start daily phonics lessons as soon as pupils start in Reception using a validated Systematic Synthetic Phonics (SSP.) We know that using an SSP benefits our pupils and staff in many ways.",

Our Latin lessons give us the opportunity to explore the relationships between Latin root words and words we use today. A single Latin root word can generate over 100 English words. This means that just teaching 10 Latin roots can give children the meaning of more than 1,000 words in English! We make links to learning about Romans and Greeks and further embed expert vocabulary used in these history lessons. Also, Latin vocabulary is hugely beneficial in understanding scientific vocabulary. For example, the Latin word \u2018ignis\u2019, which means fire, unlocks the meaning of \u2018igneous rock\u2019 for children learning about volcanoes in Year 3.",
