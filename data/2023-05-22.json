This was initially Gail Francis, Expert GCP Inspector, supported by myself, and after Gail left the MHRA in February 2022, I became the primary representative supported by Jason Wakelin-Smith, Expert GCP Inspector. The EWG has sought input from stakeholders during its work and has met many times since its inception. It has been valuable to have participated in extensive discussions with colleagues from around the world, writing the text and listening to the views of expert stakeholders as we went along.

ICH E6(R3) has been restructured and is composed of an overarching principles section, Annex 1 (interventional clinical trials), Annex 2 (additional considerations for non-traditional interventional clinical trials), Glossary and Appendices. The overarching principles, Annex 1, Glossary and Appendices will replace the current E6(R2). The development of Annex 2 will commence once the principles, Annex 1, Glossary and Appendices complete ICH step 1 with the Annex 2 concept paper being recently published.

A key change is reference to the ICH E8 (R1) general considerations for clinical studies to emphasise designing quality into a clinical trial, identifying factors that are critical to trial quality, engaging stakeholders and using a proportionate risk-based approach.

For the UK, the MHRA would expect clinical trials of investigational medicinal products (IMP) with a MHRA Clinical Trial Authorisation that are intended for marketing authorisation submissions to comply with the entire guideline and ALL trials involving an IMP, irrespective of marketing authorisation status of the IMP, to comply with the principles in section II as a minimum legal requirement.",

The principles also emphasise the importance of innovative trial designs and technologies and that this could lead to more diverse populations. There is encouragement of input from potential participants, for example to assist with feasible data collection with no undue burden on participants.

This principle also includes a new expectation for periodic review of safety information, to aim to include trial participants that are likely to use the medicinal product in future clinical practice to allow generalisation and that the delivery of medical care and medical decisions concerning participants can be undertaken by other qualified health professionals than physicians and dentists. I anticipate the latter point will be a welcome change so that trials can reflect normal clinical practice. ICH E6(R2) principle 2.9 relating to informed consent had been usefully expanded to include the legally acceptable representative, that the process reflects the situation of the trial (for example emergency research) and ensuring patients can make an informed decision by the provision of the information in a way that is concise, understandable, and using new technology when appropriate.

These concern the identification of critical to qualify factors and conducting a trial of sufficient quality to enable good decision making. There is emphasis on those areas that are beyond standard medical care. There is focus that processes, data capture and management are directly related to the trial objectives, operationally feasible, avoid unnecessary complexity and are proportionate to protection of participants\u2019 safety, rights and well-being and the reliability of the trial results.

There is new text that addresses considerations of providing new information to participants and whether re-consent would always be necessary, as this could be dependent upon the stage of the trial. I suspect that this should help investigators because it would mean that re-consenting would not be automatically undertaken, as is often seen at present, which I suggest would reduce burden on investigators. New additions address that time for consideration of participation may be reduced where justified (e.g., emergency situations). Additional text means that investigators are asked to ensure that participants are informed how their data will be handled, including if they withdraw from the trial prematurely and that the participants should have access to the trial results and the treatment they have received if they wish to do so.
