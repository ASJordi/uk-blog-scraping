However, the conversation has moved on from when ethics was discussed in more theoretical terms; the kind that resulted in many organisations publishing principles and guidelines. There is a want and need for ethics to become more practical and more tangible. People want to know how they can put principles into action, especially those relating to privacy, fairness, inclusion, environmental sustainability and explainability of systems. We\u2019re seeing this need being met through the increasing number of tech ethics and AI ethics toolkits that are being published. Ethics is also becoming more action-orientated through the diversity and number of voices contributing to calls for regulation and legislation where conversations about \u201cshould we or shouldn\u2019t we\u201d are being debated in terms of \u201ccannot\u201d and \u201cmust not\u201d.",

There will be many who say that principles are nothing but theory and built on idealism. Yes, there can be challenges with implementing some of the ethical principles and yes, there are principles that create friction with one another. However, starting from a place of idealism and the bluest of blue skies allows us to constantly be stretching towards excellence. Ambitious principles implore us to reflect and continuously improve. Another reason principles are important is because they create a moral boundary that helps to determine what good looks like. It\u2019s the reason the Service Standard, with its principles relating to users, technology and data, and teams has been so pivotal in setting the high quality standards of public service design in the UK. When we\u2019re asked to \u201cDesign for users and their needs\u201d, it means we prioritise activities that allow us to collect valuable insights from people who use our services. I could say the same thing for the rest of the 13 Service Standards. For example, the call to use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns has contributed to service teams across government championing re-use and building and maintaining common public digital goods. Toolkits are brilliant at putting theory into practice. Principles are remarkable at creating social norms that lead to desired behaviours being sustained over time.\u00a0",

Deadwood is a vital part of a healthy ecosystem supporting a wide range of insects, fungi and plants, which in turn support a range of birds and mammals.

For example, a consortium of banks may want to train a model to detect fraudulent transactions; to do so, they\u2019ll need to collect transaction data from many different banks on a central server, as shown in Figure 1(a).",

In federated learning, the central server sends a copy of the partially trained model to each participating organisation and collects model updates instead of data, as shown in Figure 1(b). Each organisation constructs its model update by training the model locally on its own sensitive data\u2014which never leaves the organisation. The resulting model updates can be aggregated and assembled to construct an improved model. This process repeats until the model is trained. Examples of successful use of federated learning include Google\u2019s Gboard, Speech, and Messages, and Apple\u2019s news personalisation and speech recognition. However, there are currently limited examples of federated learning being used to enable collaboration between different organisations without direct sharing of data \u2013 such a setup has the potential to unlock new use cases that could provide significant societal and economic benefits.",

At the moment, farmers who receive payments under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and some other agri-environment schemes must meet minimum standards to receive those payments. This is known as cross compliance. Cross compliance will end 31 December 2023. We've published guidance about what this means for farmers and land managers on GOV.UK. "
