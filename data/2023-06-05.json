There is the need to distil complex, technical information and clearly explain things like uncertainty. A great example of this was the risk assessment we produced on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via food and food packaging, which acted as the evidence base for our risk management advice throughout the pandemic.\u00a0",

It was great to see the range of transferable skills that people had to offer.

He went from being fit and healthy to lying in a coma within 5 days. Following 6 operations, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, he has been left with an Acquired Brain Injury (memory and cognitive problems), mobility issues and brain fatigue. Iain\u2019s tumour is now growing in his spine, which is inoperable, so we are in a constant round of scans and appointments to monitor his situation and decide when more treatment will be required. Because of his constant monitoring, it\u2019s difficult to plan even a holiday as you don\u2019t know from scan to scan if treatment will start.",
