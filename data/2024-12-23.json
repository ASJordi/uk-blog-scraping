We recently set out at the Chatham House Competition Policy 2024 conference and the Financial Times Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit how the benefits from promoting competition are profound and far-reaching \u2013 not just for lower prices, but also to create more innovation, choice, quality, security of supply, productivity, investment and growth.",
