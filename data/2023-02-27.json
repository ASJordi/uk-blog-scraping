When providing SEN support, whether in the classroom or across the whole school, the most important aspect of support is being able to create key relationships for children. They often have higher anxiety levels and lower tolerance levels than neurotypical children. Building relationships with members of staff helps the child to feel safe and challenge themselves to make progress. My belief is that a school could buy into every SEN resource available but if they don't have those key relationships children just won't thrive.",

So I was attracted to the civil service pretty much from school, I read quite a lot about civil service careers because I was interested in science. And I read on the scientific organisations within the Civil Service and was really interested in the kind of different work that they did and in particular the impact on society and making a difference. I came into the RPA via a circuitous route because I lived in Cumbria and the British Cattle Movement Service ran an advert in Cumbria for people to come and join them, and it was a fascinating insight. So I gave it a try. I did it initially on secondment and really got to like it. And then via a number of different events, also including the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, I ended up ensconced in the RPA and have been on a fascinating journey ever since.",

Discovering all the things that the agency did, and it's really fascinating stuff, the depth that the agency goes to, to make sure things are done right is really interesting. So, what would you say some of the challenges and successes of 2022 were and what can we take away from them?",

We, as many people know, inherited a number of very challenging circumstances and we committed to putting those right, not always seen by our customers and the public in the best of light. So, we've obviously been on a few years now trying to put that right as determined in our strategy, but particularly in there making ourselves an exemplar of operational delivery and an asset to the department and I think 2022 saw us, through our performance, and there's a saying in sport that you know tables don't lie, our performance speaks its own truth in terms of results, which shows how far we've come. But particularly pleasing was the way in which we've managed to do it. So, we haven't done so by going into crisis mode. We haven't sort of been embattled, we've done so in a way that everybody in the agency has contributed to, through our values, through our way of working, we've created something I believe here that stands us in really good stead, not just having got us through the difficulties of the past, but in really good stead for facing the future. And I think it's a really exciting future. 2023 is when we start to embark on that more fully, but 2022 I think really stood us in that stead. Across the board, we changed the way we did inspections, we've been involved with livestock information transformation, we've been at the centre of Defra's offering on grants, and people have come to realise the extent of expertise and variety of work that we do here. And of course, we've consolidated our Basic Payment Scheme payments and made huge improvements in Countryside Stewardship. So, all of those things that come together, I think that have showed us to be that exemplar that we want to be. We're still got a little way to go and one of the exciting things for 2023 is taking the next step in that journey. But we I think have taken ourselves to that place in 2022, that is less about the past, and more about the future.",

                "content": "Paul: 2023 for me is when all of the talk turns to action. Everybody is probably familiar with the things that have been said in terms of agricultural transition. One of the things that I frequently reflect on, waking up on the morning after the EU referendum. I think it's fair to say there was an extreme nervousness within the organisation as to what that means for the future, both in terms of the policy that we were responsible for administering, but also in terms of the chosen delivery vehicle and how might we be a part of that. We've come such a long way since then and we've seen all of the plans and we've seen the agricultural transition plan in the public domain. But what we've quietly and successfully done in the past few years is position ourselves in that delivery space in a way that has transitioned us from being the paying agency by right to being the delivery body of choice. And that means we've been at the heart of the Future Farming programme in order to be able to help the department realise that transition and now all of that planning, all of that talking is about to be a reality. This year, we're going to launch the next phase of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, which is the sort of, if you like, the meaty bit of it, you know we've kind of dipped our toe in the water and now we're gonna throw ourselves into it and start really swimming. We've got radical plans to change Countryside Stewardship and our ministers have confirmed Countryside Stewardship as a vehicle for the future and not just a legacy scheme. So managing those interfaces and that transition, along with our grants proposition, along with new approaches to regulation, we're gonna get to do all of that this year, which means we're gonna have to be prepared for it, it means we're gonna have to do quite a lot of work to stand it up and make sure we're ready. But it's when it all really comes to life which makes this year a really exciting prospect.",

And there's something of a virtuous circle in that because everybody wants to feel that they're doing a good job. You asked me why I came to the Civil Service and you know what I like about this organisation, and making that difference, contributing to those outcomes, knowing that you're helping people to do that. I studied quite a lot of environmental science and like everybody else, it's never been more topical than it is now. And we are able to help people to realise those ambitions, the things that we are seeing on national television, we're a part of and a part of helping the general public, but particularly farmers and landowners, to promote that agenda, and that changes the way that we relate to our customers and I think what we've learned this last 18 months is that we can do that and we\u2019re in a position to do that. We've learned the things that we need to change to be better at that. I think there are ways in which we can improve the relationships, there are ways in which we can improve the technology and the channels that we use to be able to conduct that dialogue. But I think, you know, we've learned a lot about how our customers need support and want us to be available for that support, and perhaps surprised ourselves a little bit in just how well we are placed to provide that support.",

What makes me most proud? The fact that people care so much. The fact that people are committed, really bought into what the organisation is trying to do I think. It's not always plain sailing and there are, you know clearly there's things we can learn. Our people serve our talk a lot about, you know, asking people to take part and listening to what's in there about how we can do better. And so obviously there are things about for example how we manage continuous improvement, how people are able to bring ideas to life and those sorts of things that I'd like us to maybe be better at but even that is indicative of the fact there is a strong desire to help, to do well, to be a truly excellent service and that all makes me feel really proud to be part of this organisation.

Defra and RPA listened to these concerns, acted upon them and issued a further capital payment rates announcement in mid-January with the amended scope.

To support this, the duration of agreements has increased for those that start on or after 5 January this year. Agreement Holders will now have three years to complete the capital works in their agreement, so there\u2019s less pressure to complete the actions straight away. We\u2019re also now applying more proportionate reductions if a capital claim is received late.
