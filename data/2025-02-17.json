The regulations will come into force in June 2025, and we are welcoming feedback on the guidance to ensure it is as clear and as supportive as possible ahead of that date. On 28 January, we also held our first Guidance Working Group. This is a new stakeholder group that will support the drafting of medical devices regulatory guidance documents for all the new regulations.",
