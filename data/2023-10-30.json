After all, everyone has to use the thing whether they like it or not. Unless the people designing public services spend time with their users (and non-users), the monopoly means they only infrequently glimpse the behaviours that result from poor designing: avoidance, denial, inaccurate information, false declarations and failure demand. If users do end up managing to successfully complete the transaction, their irritation, confusion, shame and distress along the way is invisible.",

The model ranks the states by the \u2018average\u2019 emotional impact, from least to most harmful. However, this is a generalisation. People experience setbacks differently, and they react differently. Importantly, the behaviours that stem from the different types of distress might be the same \u2013 for example, both a person who is frustrated and a person who is scared might completely disengage from the interaction.
