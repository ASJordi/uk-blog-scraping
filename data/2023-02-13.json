As I look back on my time with the Committee, it was this time spent with that wide range of Committee members, and the discussions that we had, that I valued most about the experience. Whilst I often looked at things from a purely technical perspective, my colleagues offered observations about how the specific proposals fit with wider policies and considered impacts that perhaps wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me. That combined knowledge and experience is what I think makes SSAC a particularly unique and valuable body. From a personal perspective, I left the Committee with a far greater understanding of the wider social security system and the broader economic social context than I had before I joined and that continues to benefit my work today.\u00a0\u00a0",

I also particularly enjoyed the visits that I took part in with SSAC. Some were to different parts of DWP operations, for example spending time in a Jobcentre with Universal Credit work coaches or visiting a telephone contact centre. Other visits involved spending time with third party organisations, seeing their work in the community and listening to the issues that their users faced daily in accessing the social security system. These opportunities were unique to being a SSAC Committee member. Not only did they allow me to understand far more about claimant experience of the system, they allowed me to see and understand the system from DWP staff perspective.
