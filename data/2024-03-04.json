We talked about how we will provide clarity for device users on how, and when a device can be used according to its intended purpose to reduce risks to patients associated with potential misuse and gave an update on the intended new definition of Software as a Medical Device.",

We continue to gather feedback from the day long Trusted Advisor Group event on International Recognition on 26 January and in parallel, work across government and the health system to ensure that others who may be impacted are involved in the process. To give more certainty, we aim to publish an outline of the International Recognition Framework for medical devices later this Spring aligned to the Life Sciences Council, subject to necessary approvals. Ahead of that we will be testing our framework by walking through it with some exemplar products to iron out key issues. These products will not be granted approvals through this process rather this will be an opportunity to test the current policy thinking in practice.",

The meeting runs from 11-15 March and includes public sessions as well as closed sessions for the IMDRF management committee only. I am excited that on one of the public days the sessions will all focus on International Recognition. I will be heading to Washington at the weekend with some of the team and the MHRA will be co-chairing one of the panels. This will be a huge opportunity for us to add to our learning not only on what has worked well in other jurisdictions but also to understand what others plan to do in the future around this critical issue. It is also a reminder of how important our regulations will be beyond the framework for International Recognition. Whether other regulators will, at some point in the future, be minded to recognise the UKCA mark is beyond my control but I do know, if that call comes, we need to be in a position where we can say the UK regulatory framework is as good as it can be, and one that other regulators should feel confident to rely on.",
