From there, they float in their larval form on ocean currents towards Europe \u2013 journeying over 3,000 miles for up to two years. Once they reach the coast, they turn into transparent glass eels (up to 8cm long) and then elvers (up to 12cm long) swimming upstream into rivers. Here they live for around 6-10 years as juveniles/sub-adult (yellow eels), before swimming downstream and eventually returning to the Sargasso Sea as mature adults to breed (silver eels)",

These structures are designed to control river levels and prevent flooding so my task is to monitor them and improve migration for the eels to overcome these barriers. Loss of eel habitat is another big factor, with rivers historically being less natural with less wetland and floodplain connectivity. To mitigate this the Environment Agency designs and installs eel passes to help eels get from the sea into the freshwater habitats and then back again as adults.

This along with all our eel specific work, reduces the impact people have on eels and this will in turn reduce stress and disease.",

Changes in ocean temperatures and currents can interfere with the migration of the eels and can affect how they breed.

With climate change we are also seeing an increase in the number of storms, which could affect eels by disrupting their incredible migration. The work we do will give eels a much better chance to cope with the environmental changes that are likely and, by continuing to learn about these fish, we can adapt and improve what we do in the future.",
