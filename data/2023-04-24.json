It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but we heard that simple tasks like this help to reduce a \u201clearned helplessness\u201d from reliance on the institution, and provide a sense of hope and preparedness for the outside world. We learned how important the technology is for those who aren\u2019t able to read or write well, and previously had to rely on filling in forms to engage with the regime.
