The first was in 2000 when I broke my spine. The second was in 2005 when we had a house fire, my boys were both under two at the time, and we had to move into rented accommodation. The third was when I returned to work in 2011 after having my youngest and the last was in 2015 when I was on the road delivering training.

I thought I had planned for everything until I got a call five days before the party saying the caterer had COVID-19. Instead of panicking I recruited my mum and best friend to help me recreate the menu, after all we were now restricted to a maximum of 30 guests. In the end everything went well and my son ended up with two parties, the first with family and a small number of mates and a second with just friends.

I could never understand why people\u2019s imaginations were so limited (my answer was usually \u201cno, but I might have a bilingual secretary\u201d). So, language degree accomplished, but beginning to realise my superpower was actually organising stuff, I looked around to see what to do next and discovered there was such a thing as a Translations Project Manager. This seemed to perfectly merge the two, so off I went on my career. I spent 10 years at that, eventually running a small translation company, all during a period when the internet was just starting to exist. Out of necessity, I kept up with the opportunities presented by doing stuff digitally and did what was necessary to make the workflow as efficient as possible, learning a lot about IT along the way.\u00a0",

Previously to that it was all very much private sector and building online learning platforms for students across the world and sort of really fancied a change. And kind of looking to what the public sector we're doing, and particularly how we are looking to transform our services, and putting the citizen need at the heart of everything we do. And that's very much where we are going now within the health world. Because part of my responsibilities about developing delivering the technology strategy for major government projects, such as a health transmission programme, which currently is delivering 2.2 million assessments a year. But we also have a number of other services such as Access To Work, and New Style ESA, which, although they are entirely separate benefit lines, actually, from our point of view in this conversation today, that you have to call the kit, in the same technology ecosystem, which therefore creates the challenges which means we have to have isolation and separation. Fundamentally all accountabilities within this space from a technology security point of view and the related practices fall under me and we are ever growing stronger.

Actually, prior to joining DWP, I've worked in a few different sectors as well. So local government, I spent quite a bit of time in higher education, but also working across private sector in IT consultancy in kind of fin tech roles. Most recently, my focus has really been around cloud platforms and kind of adding automation and software engineering work streams.

Before I joined DWP, I had a stint working in an airline and worked in the IT there delivering kind of mobility solutions for pilots, worked a lot on kind of iPad apps and making paperless cockpits, which was quite interesting. Going back even further, yeah, my background is probably more hardware focused. So, going from kind of microprocessor design and micro-electronics and then into hardware software interfacing, and then took the path of software engineering from there. And yeah, more recently being a lead software engineer, it is trying to, you know, promote good engineering practices and standards across health, and wider DWP and trying to breakdown some of the barriers that we have between our different engineering families as well.",

And when we talk about things like the health assessment service, for example, as well as internal DWP agents. Regardless of who the end user is, though, we need to make sure that we are fitting our user needs thinking about the citizen at the heart of everything we do. The purpose of this is to transform our complex internal Legacy estate into a modern microservice, cloud native architecture, which does put all those flexibilities at the heart of what we want to make sure we are thinking about how we can achieve the best services for our citizens ultimately at the end of the day, but also having a cost thought as well, because ultimately, we don't want to waste taxpayers money. And the team remits are split between those focused on end products. So, there'll be the services which people be interacting with directly. But also, we've got a core part of what we call the enabling teams. And the remit of these are to put in the foundations in place to allow the product teams to succeed ultimately, and part of this is the creation and standardisation around ephemeral environments, which is what we're going to be talking about today. And to standardisation around our deployment processes. The idea here is that the product teams don't need to keep reinventing the wheel around this, and removes the cognitive load of them sort of trying to face up the challenges of how to get base functionality from a development laptop, all the way through into production, we sort of take that on in a more holistic view within health and disability.",

So ephemeral environments, you know, as we mentioned before are throw away environments, and you need some kind of wider foundations to get the best use of them. So, you need some automation and some infrastructures code to define your environments. And allow you to stand them up in a repeatable way. So, what that essentially means is we can very our set-up, so we invest in our foundations and get that foundational platform. So, we can create ephemeral environments as and when needed. And then it's logic config to define what size we want, what scale, what hardware software, and we can vary that as when required to meet the needs. So we can have, if we're doing feature development, you know, and we're working with teams or a team of developers on multiple teams, they can have quite small scale environments, that don't need to cost a lot, but they can do whatever proofing they need. Whereas we might decide to spin up a full size, kind of prod like environment, doing some performance testing, or might choose to do that, you know, or the schedule might do every night. So, it's, we've got that. Yeah, configurability, to do exactly what we needed and to meet the needs.",

So from the beginning of what we're trying to do within development, it actually effectively looks exactly the same as how it operates within production. And it's that sort of building up.

So just to put a bit of kind of setting the scene on this one, I'm sure as engineers, we've all been in a situation where the development lifecycle is often stalled due to maybe the QA environment being used to test something. That gives you an inability to kind of develop and deploy and test your features because someone else is using it for their purpose. Or there could be scenarios where maybe there's specific versions of the application deployed on some fixed infrastructure to support maybe some third party testing or something that's going on. And again, that prevents you from being able to kind of test and develop, improve the things that you need to do. So really, with ephemeral environment, what we're trying to do is remove that constraint. We don't want fixed infrastructure, we don't want a fixed number of environment, we want to kind of build and scale these to the needs of the product and the need of the development team. So in smaller teams, yeah, they might only have one or two kind of spun up at any one point in time. Whereas if we're working on maybe multiple feature teams working together on the same application, they may have dozens of environment being been built. And equally, the same applies all the way through the development lifecycle. So it's not just development, it's testing as well. Let's say we need a full side production scaled environment to do some performance tests on. But let's say another team also comes along with it. Well, I want to run something on that performance test environment. Well, we're not constrained by having a performance test environment. Basically, we treat that as a type of environment, and we'll just provision another one. So it enables us to kind of run parallel development, life cycles, be able to run parallel tests and effectively what we're trying to do is just increase teams velocity.",

So rather than having prototypes being done in isolation of real life running environment, we are now able to actually alter a user journey, put it out in a non-production environment and allow for user research to get done against that. And the reason for that is the fact that these things will only exist for a handful of hours or a day, say, whilst those research sessions are going on, then they are obliterated. So, if in the unlikely event that there was some form of compromise, from a security point of view, the blast radius is actually greatly minimized because these things don't live for a long period of time, they are just there for the one purpose, which gives us that extra flexibility in making sure that we use the technologies for what we wanted to but also leverage the learnings and quick and move everything to the left. Because we want to make sure that we're getting that sort of quick ecosystem changes, building in right from getting rather than having everything go up to production before we can do some of these user research sessions or accessibility testing points of view.",

So I'm sure we've all got experience of where we deployed to one environment and everything seems to be okay, so maybe we're deploying to dev, and everything seems fine. And then when you start promoting through the environments towards prod, so maybe we'll get into staging or something, and things stop working and blowing up and we don't know why, it's because something's been iterated in the dev environment and that that hasn't been replicated or consolidated in code. And that that used to happen quite a lot. And that by using ephemeral environments, and the codify nature of them with automation, so all environments are essentially the same, it kind of removes that possibility to have conflict drift. So there's a real benefit there, over long lived environments. And I was also just going to mention the kind of the cost versus restaurant risk factor as well. So again, I'm sure many have been in situation where, you know, it might have been really nice to do some volume tests, but actually, that means going to have to spin up a performance test environment, it needs to be small scale, or it's going to take a while to do that, with infrastructure guys needed to be on hand to do to help. So we might not do it, or we might carry some risk forward and hope things go well, or may try and infer some metrics out of scaled environments. Again, we don't need to worry about, nor the time that's going to need to build this extra environment, it's all automated and codified. We don't need to worry about kind of interpolating results, either we can have a full-scale environment, or environments of any config. As and when we need them. We only pay for their up time and then we destroy them once they're gone. So it's benefits in that regard.",

And they'll ultimately bring them all into alignment over the course of the next six months, I imagine. In terms of benefit, we've been able to move to regular, most teams now releasing weekly. So as soon as we sort of get user research information that lets us, you know, improve a service we can get that through development, we can put it through the pipeline, we\u2019ve got all of the all the automation through the testing cycles, and people can release as needed. Because of that standardisation through both the creation of the environment and the deployment of it, we're able to actually if we need to release on the same day basis as well, which is quite a shift from where the department used to approach things with sort of long lead in times, where it's sort of, it's allowing us to move everything to the left, get our assurance, because we're designing for production right from the beginning, all the way through to the end.",

But often when they then promote that, and try and run it on a real infrastructure and run some tests against it, or where you're kind of at the latter stages where it's making its way to production. There's often been instances where failures have occurred, because the environments have differed. But I think that one of the key benefits of kind of implementing this pattern is because we've got a single code base, a single code base, stand up infrastructure, that's not only used for development and testing, but it's the same code that actually provisions the production environment. If a developer comes along and wants to actually do something, we can effectively build them a production environment. So if they can develop a feature, and get it all functional and tested and approved in in a non-production in a test environment, we stand a really good chance that, by the time that comes to being deployed in production, it's just going to work, because effectively it's all deploying on the same infrastructure.",

We do new things as code so they are repeatable, and they can be executed as required. But because we've got that automation in place when we build these environments as well, we can slot things into that automation. So, we can run tests, we've talked about tests, we can run them after an environment built. But we can also do other things that we do, various security checks, security scans, we can smoke test our environments to make sure that everything looks good and healthy. So that's all great. And that's a pattern that that our engineers can adopt them and reuse, so they don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. But they are in control as well. So we try to empower our teams.

They might be using these to kind of run demos, maybe undertake training sessions. But a lot of this has actually been enabled, because we've automated the process of spinning up an environment. So where traditionally, if you wanted an environment, you'd maybe have to speak to an infrastructure guy or a DevOps guy or something to kind of book their time and get them to actually do something for you. Because we've got this single codebase and this automated tool train to enable us to effectively press a button. So it's self-service, that someone can come along and as long as they've got permission to do it, they can press a button and self-serve themselves and environment, use it for whatever they need to do, as I say, to run demo or training session and so on. And then at the end of the day that things automatically destroyed.

Prior to working within health, we did actually, a small number of our engineers were working on replatforming one of DWP other legacy monolithic applications. And it was here that we kind of cut our teeth on developing and proving the initial ephemeral patterns that subsequently we've adopted inside of health. That application was, as I say, kind of a large application, it was written using technology that wasn't necessarily cloud native. But we were still able to implement ephemeral patterns and using kind of automated test pipelines and modern tooling, even though the actual application technology underneath that powered it might have been considered a legacy. Of course, it's kind of not without its challenges in doing this, and there is a degree of investment in time that's needed to develop the infrastructure as code, develop the pipelines and everything else to support it. And certainly, when we're talking about older applications, especially those when maybe there's licensed software in the mix, it becomes a little bit more difficult. Especially if we take for example, maybe you've got a licensed database component, and you can't necessarily license this on an hourly basis. So the idea of potentially spinning up dozens of ephemeral environments, and then someone being landed with a bill and go, well, actually, we need to buy dozens of licenses to fund these, it doesn't necessarily kind of have that synergy. But there are there are some creative solutions that you can employ in terms of maybe in kind of more environments to the left of the lifecycle that you might be putting marks in there, or you might be having feature toggles that turn off some of these more expensive license components. And a lot of this, again, can be automated. So, a developer might be working in development environment that that they kind of build and cut through their pipeline. And then once they've proven their feature in their environment, once it gets promoted through the tool chain to an environment, a test environment to the right. That's when some of these license components may be enabled. And again, that can be fully automated.",

Through this, this has all been through, obviously, our internal security processes to make sure that we are conforming to all relevant standards, we've obviously been pushing the standards out as well to sort of make sure we adopt a strength and depth approach across the state. So making sure that we have a number of commensurate and controls within not just sort of running environments, but our data access layers, so that by layering up different controls, we actually a) simplify the state and make more supportable but also b) strengthen the security posture, because we are constantly under attack due to the fact that we are a government organisation.

And the idea of when we promote from our non-production environment into our production environment. We're not necessarily promoting into a live already built production environment. Quite often what we're doing is we're taking our infrastructures as code, code base, and building a brand-new production environment so it's all fresh, it's nice and clean. And we know what the steady state is and then once we're happy that that deployment been successful, then we'll automatically flip over and our live traffic will come into that new production environment.

And previously, I talked about how easy it is to create environments, click button or create a branch, if you want to make a change, we have got some controls around our release process and making those changes into our product count. So we have got separation of duties. So while it's really easy to get started and start developing, once all of all of your changes are proven, we have got a release process in place with segregation of duties that make sure that we go into production in a controlled manner. And we create the new ephemeral environment, do the blue/green, switchover, in a really controlled and inscribed manner, to reduce any risk. We invest in foundations of, of our designs, for ephemeral environments, we do a lot of work up front. And when we design for prod so, we might be spinning up kind of dev type environments for very initial feature driven development. But all of our design thinking is for prod, this thing's going to end up in prod, at some point. And all of our environments are the same. So let's not cut features out in early stages, and leave ourselves open to risk or, you know, significant change later on. Let's think about all the things we need to compensate and bring them forward. What that means is you do spend time on foundations. But that's time well spent.

So, whilst our initial proving and kind of build out of the foundations was done on a single application, this was really to make sure that we invested enough time in those foundations and made sure that the patterns and the implementation code and everything else that underpins it was reusable across all of our applications in health. So, from having maybe only two or three projects at the start of the year, we're now in a situation where on a daily basis, we've got dozens of environments being spun up by teams within health throughout the day. And we've got projects kind of in the pipeline who are ready to adopt this approach as well. And it's very much been a bit of a kind of self-service effort for the teams as well. As we touched on we work as part of an enablement team. So, we build the patterns. And we built the standards and the code fragments and the like that underpin this. But that very much the intent was to empower teams to actually adopt this themselves. So, it's not an effort that requires engineering kind of input centrally, it's very much a case of here is the pattern. And here is the implementation architecture.

And this tends to be third parties who don't necessarily follow the same patterns around ephemeral environment and may operate kind of more fixed infrastructure. So, to kind of put some context around this, if we are developing features that interfaces with these third parties, quite often we need to run tests between our environments and their environments. But if they run on fixed infrastructure, quite often, we might have to book time to actually give us a slot on their environment and make their engineers aware that they need to deploy certain versions of their components. And ultimately, this kind of lacks the flexibility that we might otherwise have, from a self-contained point of view. So, whilst maintaining ephemeral environment within health within our own domain, and within different applications and products within the health domain, we certainly are afforded this flexibility. But when we start interfacing with maybe other teams within the department, or externally, who don't necessarily implement the same sort of patterns, this can cause some sort of issues.",

And it took a while for us to be able to show and demonstrate actually, all the key benefits. And we did that largely through by, as Phil mentioned earlier, though, starting small was an exemplar project. And were therefore able to demonstrate it. I think, if, I was able to have my time again, I would probably sort of tried to come up with more materials and narrative, to sell that story upfront without actually having to have done the physical execution of that work. And I would recommend for people listening to the podcast, or if they're interested in learning, or any of these things to come and speak to the teams getting a real life viewpoint of how they find operating this new way of working, because it is a quite a big mindset shift, you really are going to the left on lots of things.

In this situation, if anything of that nature creeps in, then you\u2019ve broken the flow, you're broken that end to end journey of automation and until that that's repaid in terms of that debt you\u2019ve broken your process.

In any part of this. If you start introducing manual processes, you basically break all the benefits of going down that road. So, you have to be really lightning focused on automation through every aspect and finding ways to do that.

And if we could break down some of that manual effort that teams are doing at the moment and automate it, and have the flexibility to spin up environments on demand and kind of connect to them and run tests between them, it really does take us one step closer to automating the entire tool chain all the way from a developer checking in code to that actually being deployed in production in a kind of repeatable, assured, but hands off way.",
