This is often cited as a parable for how we tend to ignore the simplest solutions. There was also an element of making assumptions about what people want; men were seen as the main travellers, and they were too macho to want assistance with carrying their heavy bags. In theory, our core intended audience of well qualified scientists and analysts should have no trouble interpreting environmental information. It is natural to wonder if it is worth the effort to present information to them in a user-friendly website rather than in its original report format. However, we are all people, and a document of well over one hundred pages would have anyone reaching for another cup of coffee and considering how necessary it is to wade through the whole thing. Sometimes the simple wins, like being able to find a result in seconds, can make the difference for getting an important message out to as many people as possible.",

This was the epitome of the bureaucracy and inefficiency that you had probably read about in the news over the years. Hardware and software were old and inefficient and it could take months and large amounts of money to change into something that worked well for the users. Our users mainly thought of the IT systems as a necessary evil and longed for the days when they could keep their records on paper, or better still on the wall of their wing office and could update with a chinagraph pencil (my dad was a prison officer and he still laments the decline of the chinagraph pencil even though these days he mostly uses an iPad).",

This was different though. The team had spoken to the users of the system, and not just the senior managers who think they know what the users should do, the actual users of the system.

The attraction of the DM role is that no days are the same. The list of roles you need to cover for the team is huge, from problem solver to bean counter and from coach to process enthusiast. Your job is to help the team wherever they need it to make them a better team and shield them from the things that could distract them, but most importantly to make sure that there is some enjoyment to be had from work.\u00a0",

Making small changes to appreciate others' work and efforts can massively improve morale and make the workplace a much more enjoyable place to be. Obviously, this is much harder remotely, but doing things to be inclusive with people in and out of your team can make such a difference, and these small differences over time can lead to a change in mindset through the organisation.
