Holding this water on site for longer into the spring and summer will maintain optimum conditions for ground nesting wading birds and support other plant and animal communities.

Water levels are very high with extensive areas of splashy grassland being created and water spilling out of the ditches at field level, so exactly what we want. Hopefully, we should see some lapwing prospecting and moving across from nearly RSPB Vange Marshes to take advantage of this new habitat, but it may take a couple of seasons for them to establish.\u201d",
