Many of these diseases have no effective treatment and have the potential to cause high numbers of mortalities in aquatic animals, with the consequent large economic loss and threat to biodiversity. Official control of diseases through policy and legislation is necessary to ensure a sustainable aquaculture industry that meets international standards and ensures safe trade. To be effective, disease controls must use applied science and research to inform Government policy and direct the appropriate legislation. This requires strong links between industry, science, and government. The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) at Cefas facilitates these vital connections. The resulting specialist relationships that exist between the FHI and the diagnosticians, epidemiologists, and research scientists at Cefas, and with Government and other agencies, contributes to the high standard of aquatic animal health controls for diseases of national importance, to support sustainable aquaculture and food from water.",

Their work is delivered on behalf of Defra and Welsh Government through industry authorisation and registration, compliance and disease surveillance inspection programmes, trade controls and disease investigation, and where necessary the application of statutory disease controls and enforcement measures. Collectively, the FHI have extensive experience in the aquaculture industry and related sectors for aquatic animal health and husbandry, regulation and disease control, fieldwork, biosecurity, and policy advice to Government. The FHI operate a paperless inspection, sample and data collection system which provides a large industry dataset extending back over 20 years, an invaluable tool for epidemiological modelling. A close collaborative working relationship between the FHI and Cefas research scientists also supports investigations into new and emerging diseases, an area of growing importance for the expansion of aquaculture to support sustainable food production.",

In the UK, an estimated 12,000-14,000 people per year experience sickness and diarrhoea after eating seafood, usually raw oysters. Frequently shellfish-borne illness is caused by the group of viruses known as noroviruses. Norovirus is an extremely common infection with an estimated 3 million cases per year in the UK, mostly (~84%) transmitted via person-to-person contact, but oysters, exposed to noroviruses when human sewage enters their growing areas, can be vehicles of disease. It is estimated that over 13 million oyster meals are served in the UK annually, many of them consumed raw, so whilst the odds of contracting norovirus from eating raw oysters are relatively low, anyone who has ever suffered with the virus will know just how unpleasant it is. Not only unpleasant but highly transmissible with a very low infectious dose - as few as 10 viral particles can cause illness. This is important for our work as it can be shellfish-borne outbreaks that seed larger restaurant setting and wider community outbreaks, which ultimately may close food outlets, schools and hospital wards every year. With the heightened awareness of the impacts of readily transmissible viruses within the population and the ability of norovirus infections to add further pressure on healthcare settings, our role in highly sensitive food testing and epidemiology has never been more important.",

However, over the years our scientists from the Food Safety group at Cefas\u2019 Weymouth laboratory have been involved in dozens of high-profile cases where oysters were the suspected food vehicle, behind the scenes helping our colleagues at Food Standards Agency (FSA), Public Health England (PHE), Environmental Health and industry try to piece together the complex jigsaw that makes up a foodborne illness investigation.",

This enables us to identify levels of RNA that may be associated with increased health risks (an important consideration as an end product standard for norovirus is currently under consideration). In addition, we are able to track decreasing levels of norovirus contamination as a result of natural clearance in the harvesting waters and help inform the decision to reopen.",

Although oyster samples are frequently contaminated with multiple strains of norovirus (reflecting the large diverse populations served by sewage treatment works upstream of the oyster beds), in a recent outbreak we found that all oysters were unusually contaminated with just a single strain, giving a 100% sequence match to norovirus from human faecal samples characterised by the PHE Enteric Virus Unit as part of the same investigation. This result confirmed the oysters as the vehicle of infection and pointed to an original contamination of the shellfish beds linked to just one, or a very small number of ill people in the catchment.",

Detection of RNA using PCR methods rather than directly detecting live virus means that results must be interpreted carefully, and meanwhile Cefas has been looking at complementary testing methods that provide additional information on infectivity. In addition, metabarcoding of non-outbreak samples has thrown up some unexpected results; while the overwhelming majority of strains identified have been infectious to humans, some oyster samples were contaminated with rarely identified norovirus strains linked to infection in rodents and porpoises!",

We received the first batch of isolates in 2021 and have been busy checking that the strains survived their 6,000-mile journey. Over the next few months, the food safety microbiology team will be characterising these novel and geographically diverse isolates which comprise pathotypes spanning almost half a century, including the earliest Vp isolates implicated in human disease. Once complete we will add this unique biological resource to our open access linked databases of Vp strains via the FAO Reference Centre for Bivalve Mollusc Sanitation online-tool, enabling researchers in Cefas, and from around the world to access information supporting studies on comparative virulence mechanisms, method development, pathogen evolution, food safety risk assessment, impacts of environmental change\u00a0 and much more.",

Sentinel have developed a technology that can see that invisible laser radiation and knows where it is and what it is. The goal is to create a product that can provide users with this information which will provide greater situational awareness and ultimately save lives.
