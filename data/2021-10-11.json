Amusing but, the message was strong and clear - criminals will enter false information onto an Annex VII in an attempt to mislead us or hoping we will not check. Industries as well as us can and should carry out these checks. This is a really quick, effective way to reduce opportunities for criminals to break the rules. To bring home the importance of doing these checks, Carl played a BBC video that showed plastic being dumped and burned in the deserts of Turkey.
