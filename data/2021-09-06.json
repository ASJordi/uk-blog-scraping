The impact to my family of being at home for prolonged periods, with reduced social contact, with me working long hours, has not been ideal. A few years ago, one of my family members became increasingly anxious and started to self-harm. They attempted to end their life on at least 2 occasions, thankfully unsuccessfully. Our local mental health system and GP were fantastic, sweeping in to help within days, offering cognitive behaviourtherapy and later art therapy. Now, almost a year later we are seeing steady improvements, but the road is not always in a straight line and sometimes feels to be mainly uphill in direction.",

Talking about mental ill-health whether it is your own, a family member or friend can be very difficult especially in a work environment.

At a time when so many of us are working remotely and missing those face-to-face conversations or chats over coffee, it is easy to miss the subtle social cues that a colleague needs support.\u00a0 So, it is essential that we take time to ask how things are going and are they ok? Some colleagues will always find it difficult to share the struggles that they or a loved one are facing with others, so it is important that we all try and be supportive and understanding colleagues because that might make the difference to them.\u201d",
