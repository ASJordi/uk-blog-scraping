For fishers, detailed catch information enables them to optimise the use of the fish quotas available to them, thus improving the economic efficiency of their businesses. This also means unintended catches can be reduced, in turn minimising the fishing pressure and ecosystem impacts. For scientists, improved catch data means more confidence in the advice provided on the sustainable levels of fishing and the ability to inform decisions and policy. For example, data on European crab and lobster stocks are limited; this restricts the management options for the sustainable exploitation of these stocks. Improved catch information can also inform fisheries managers on levels of compliance with regulations and can be used as the basis for developing effective new management measures to support stock sustainability.",

We tested the use of adding artificial lights to trawls to increase the possible escape of unwanted fish and reduce discards. Working onboard a beam trawler in the southwest of England with our project partner Interfish, and with individual skippers of otter trawlers in the English Channel and North Sea, the new SmartGear light technology was trialled in various positions on the trawls. The new technology, which can be remotely programmed to produce different types of light delivered through a flexible fibre optic cable, stood up to the rigorous test of being attached to trawls during commercial fishing operations. The experiments showed that individual species will react differently to the light output. This new technology has the potential to improve the selectivity of nets by modifying the behaviour of fish during the trawling process resulting in a reduction of discards.",

Another recent field study found that ozone and NOx at levels below standards set for the protection of sensitive habitats reduced flower visits by pollinators by 83-90%[ii]. Air pollution results in it being more difficult for pollinators such as honeybees to recognise, locate and memorise the location of their floral resources which impacts foraging efficiency and consequently pollination.

In Denmark, fertiliser application and atmospheric nitrogen deposition have caused devils-bit scabious to be outcompeted by faster growing, less sensitive plant species. This decline in host plant abundance has led to the collapse of some marsh fritillary populations[iv].

Several recent studies have shown that this leads to slower growth and development of invertebrate larvae. This can cause misalignment of the timing of larval development and the critical growth stages of their host plant species[vi]. For example, a reduction in numbers and local extinctions of the wall brown butterfly (Lasiommata megera) was caused both by the loss of host plants and by microclimate cooling due to excess nitrogen[vii].",

Impacts to the environment from air pollution are a universal and transboundary, as well as a local issue but are often overlooked as visible damage is difficult to directly attribute to air pollution. It is essential to recognise that the impact of air pollution will act in-combination with other environmental pressures. Pollution effects are also highly dependent on factors such as temperature and precipitation, therefore adverse effects are also likely to increase under predicted climate change[ix].",

This was only possible because of the work that the provider payments team had put in. This new funding model, with new business processes, that will pave the way for future capability has now paid \u00a3millions of Employer Incentives and many more millions are in the system. We can also see who has registered, entered an apprenticeship start, and been paid, from being nudged as part of a Campaign through to the call to action as we collect and analyse the data as part of the underpinning data strategy.",

It's not a problem, we're just going to replay those playbooks, we destroyed enough of the servers to fit in the data migration, played out some data migration servers, start the migration, and when it's finished we'll just replay them and put them back in where they were.

I would say, this is probably my third large government department that I've worked for. So, I've worked for MOD, FCO. So now with the DWP, I can very much see that all departments feel the same sort of pain of legacy workloads and reinvigorating and bringing stuff, so don't feel like you've got to boil the ocean in the first step. Llike really use that agile methodology, but also don't feel like you've got to do a start to finish agile, break them up into little parts and things.",

So we'll be looking in the next few weeks and months once we've got the platforms delivered to start adopting some of the new storage policies. So, Stuart has been down a few times talking about replication factor one. We're trying to, not just our Nutanix platform, but every platform that we run, Ansible-ise that, infrastructure as code that but we're also taking that into the application stacks. So we'll be asking applications in the future to define themselves as code so we can run backup as code strategies and we can reduce our backup storage limits and licencing on premise.",

So just really going further into it and breaking some of those DWP barriers down again, getting out of that mindset that we're a government department. So we can't necessarily do things like the private sector. Using some more SAS services, like I say, Git lab, looking to bring on-premise, as a software as a service from cloud, we're looking to host our artefacts up there, we're looking to really get to those DevOps principles so that we can unify the way we do things. And we don't have a pocket of team doing something like the private sector over here. And then a group of people that are still 20 years in the past doing things traditionally with point and click and all the rest of it. So really, getting into an infrastructure as code, adopting things like containers and software as a service.
