Leaving school at 16, he found an admin job to support himself and continued his education in the evenings. By 1947 he was married with four sons and had a job as a stenographer (a PA in today\u2019s language) in the Civil Service in the city of Lahore. In June 1947, Viscount \u2018Dickie\u2019 Mountbatten announced the boundary of the new countries of India and Pakistan, which cut right through the centre of Punjab - home to substantial Muslim, Hindu and Sikh populations. The date of transfer was set as 15 August \u2013 10 weeks away. This announcement provoked the greatest migration of people in history, with an estimated 10-20 million displaced and nearly 2 million killed in the resulting riots and chaos. My grandfather and his family had to leave everything \u2013 his home, job and community behind in Lahore and migrate to the new, smaller country of India. In the chaos of the journey, my uncle Tej who was three at the time, got separated from the family. Luckily, four days later, a distant relative spotted him and brought him back. Despite having lost everything and having to re-establish his family, livelihood and career afresh, my grandfather made sure his five children were all educated well, worked hard and were successful.",

My grandfather, who worked away from the family for long periods of time, insisted that the children wrote to him in English to enhance their education. Dad excelled at school, going on to gain a degree in engineering. In the mid 1960s, the UK government was recruiting for recent graduates, especially doctors, teachers and engineers, from India and elsewhere, to help address skill shortages and help rebuild the economy. My father, like many other young men in their mid 20s were tempted to see the world. He applied for and got a permanent visa, but then changed his mind about coming over. After lots of family debate, he finally arrived at Heathrow airport on 6 June 1965, two days before his visa was due to expire. Once again, as an immigrant he was in an unknown environment, with no friends, little money, but with a sense of adventure and the determination to work hard and make a better life for himself and his family. He joined forces with a group of young men who were in a similar position. They learnt to cook together, helped each other out financially and to find houses to rent and buy. They became each other\u2019s family. He worked with construction companies in the Reading area and was involved in the construction of the M4, M40 and the runway at Heathrow airport.

They were pretty fed up with me at school, as I cried a lot and took a long time to make any friends.

I looked like everyone else, even if I didn\u2019t quite sound like them for a while. I had a normal happy childhood and eventually did ok at school and university.

That is why government organisations started intensifying their citizen engagement beyond widely common ethnographic user research practices, working with under-represented groups often far away from decision-making and power. It also reflects the collective recognition of the limits of the user-centred design approach and the potential of design to play a significant role in orchestrating necessary shifts in decision-making.\n\nOn a local level, Camden Council in northwest London has used a public consultation to co-draft its Climate Action Plan, a five-year programme of projects and activities to bring its vision of a zero-carbon borough to life.",
