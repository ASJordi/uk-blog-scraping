There are some, let's call them traditional wargamers, who are all about the tabletop and the manual game. Then there are those looking at hybrid; a manual delivery of a wargame but with digital capture of the data. Then there are those that think that digital wargaming is the only way forwards. There are issues with all of them and there are some digital wargames that are really good at what they do for a specific purpose, usually in the tactical space. After the initial question of \u2018does this challenge need a wargame?\u2019, the next question should be \u2018what kind of wargame is fit for purpose?\u2019",
