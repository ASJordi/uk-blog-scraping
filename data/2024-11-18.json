Our films for the Windrush Lessons Learned Review presented first-hand experiences of immigration policy and provided the review team with an important alternative form of insight and evidence. We have used co-design in numerous projects as a collaborative approach to developing policies which involves people affected by the policy or policy challenge. A recent example is access to language learning for refugees.
