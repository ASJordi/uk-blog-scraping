Increased temperatures and more frequent flooding events cause mosquito populations to flourish and provide conditions that could enable a non-native species such as the Asian tiger mosquito to become established. When these changes are combined with an increase in global travel and movement of animals and humans around the world, there is an increased risk of a new vector-borne disease becoming established in our mosquito populations or entering the UK through a non-native species. Research on the impact of climate change to the UK arthropod distribution and disease transmission is therefore vital.",
