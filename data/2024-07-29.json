We recently secured further nutrient mitigation at Lyscombe Farm in Dorset, where 3,700 homes can now be built within the Poole Harbour catchment while numerous rare birds, such as avocets, spoonbills and black-tailed godwits will be protected from additional pollution. Our position has not changed that new development should not worsen the condition of these sites and to maintain the environmental protection that underpins it.
