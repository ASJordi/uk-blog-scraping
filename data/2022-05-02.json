Without this, a potentially vulnerable person and their supporter is left in significant distress.

That\u2019s some real weirdness right there and it takes some getting used to. Then there are other design challenges that crop up like capturing consent from the person getting the support, and adapting guidance so that those who are supporting have the language they need to explain what the service is requesting and what decisions need to be made clearly to someone else. Building in safeguards, to reduce the risk of undue pressure and coercion, takes time. Consideration also needs to be given to how the kind of supported journeys that are described above should be designed differently to professional support services that solicitors, accountants, charities etc provide.

So, when the SFI live service is launched there\u2019ll be no application submission deadline and the RPA will process applications on a rolling basis.

So all we would ask is that our panel members try to participate in at least one piece of research a year or attend at least one meeting a year. These can be virtual, on the phone or in person. But the only commitment we\u2019re asking to sign up is one. They can absolutely do more if they want to, so they\u2019ll be invited to various bits of research and we\u2019ll also try to keep it as relevant as we can. So we won\u2019t be asking arable farmers about their opinions on our livestock services, so it\u2019ll be very much built around what they\u2019re eligible for, but what they participate in will be very much in their control. And people can always leave the Group if they want to, although of course we really hope that they don\u2019t; but in that event all they\u2019d need to do is drop us an email and ask to be taken off the mailing list.",

We may put some of the findings on our GOV.UK page as well, our Twitter page, on Facebook or we may email, write or update people on the telephone.

There will be times when we can\u2019t always do everything we wish we could do with the feedback but even in those scenarios, we will still go back to people and say we\u2019ve listened, this is what we\u2019d like to be able to do, maybe it\u2019s not possible just yet but it\u2019s very much on our notepad for the future.

Recently what we did was get some customers to give us their views on the videos we have on our YouTube page. So these were how to tutorials really and, as a result of the feedback that we got, we\u2019re making improvements to the voiceover, we\u2019re clarifying the introductions, giving more information within the video and also looking at accessibility is greater detail. So the feedback that we\u2019ve already had is already having such a tremendous impact and we\u2019ll be sharing those new and improved videos with the customers who helped with this project first and thanking them for their suggestions.
