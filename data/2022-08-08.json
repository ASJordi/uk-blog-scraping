Every year, the Environment Agency reminds fishery owners to prepare for dry and warm weather, to make sure they have done what they can to avoid or minimise the risks of fish deaths in their waters. Through written advice and guidance, workshops and social media, we advise on managing water levels to maintain cooler deep water for fish to take refuge in and to carry out any fishery management work early in the year to avoid placing extra stress on fish. It\u2019s important for fishery operators to take dissolved oxygen readings to get an early warning of an incident developing and to have access to aerators if they suddenly find they need to react. In many cases, we have used the income we receive from fishing licence sales to part-fund this equipment for clubs. Some angling clubs are taking full advantage of mobile technology, linking their remote oxygen meters directly to a mobile phone so they get instant alerts. Over time, more and more fisheries have invested significantly in the equipment and infrastructure to offset the worse impacts.",

On the Herefordshire Wye, a voluntary agreement not to fish on many stretches is in place until conditions for the fish improve.

Every year, we respond to hundreds of reports of fish in distress because of dry and warm conditions. Where fish are trapped in drying sections of river, we need to act quickly to catch and transfer them to neighbouring reaches. They will wait here until autumn when rainfall allows them to recolonise upstream. Where a still water coarse fishery shows signs of an algal bloom developing or where fish are already in distress, we will deploy emergency aeration to boost dissolved oxygen levels. Aeration comes in all shapes and sizes, from propeller and paddlewheel aerators to injecting hydrogen peroxide directly into the water. Usually, aeration simply provides a refuge where fish can congregate until more favourable conditions return. We only have a limited number of aerators and, in a warm summer, sometimes not enough to go around. We always encourage fishery operators to buy or even to make their own \u2013 see how to here.",

River augmentation schemes - releases from reservoirs and from groundwater \u2013 keep flows from falling below critical levels and are often timed to help migrating fish upstream or to sustain them and other species until natural flows return. A good example of this, as reported in our last blog, is the River Severn Regulation, where reservoir and groundwater releases are used in combination to maintain flows in the lower river. Similar schemes operate on other rivers around the country.",
