The scheme will develop at different rates in different catchments based on these factors.\nBy reserving credits (via nutrient certificates issued by Natural England) developers provide assurance to LPAs that they can satisfy nutrient neutrality planning conditions. This will allow them to proceed with the development subject to any other planning conditions. Once payment for credits has been made, and any related planning conditions discharged, new homes can be occupied.",

The scheme will not allow banking of credits by developers.\nDevelopers will still be able to source credits from other suppliers/ markets, deliver credits via on-site features such as Sustainable Drainage Systems and/or deliver their own off-site nutrient mitigation in consultation with Natural England and the LPA.\nApplications will be assessed where projects can demonstrate:\n\u2022 Minimising delays to development as a result of nutrient pollution\n\u2022 Enabling development of the most homes, most quickly\n\u2022 Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for which mitigation is harder to deliver on-site and for which the cost of mitigation is proportionally higher per house.\n\u2022 Development of affordable and social housing",

A detailed feasibility study by the University of Exeter confirmed the suitability of mixed farmland in southern England for a possible reintroduction. The Salisbury Plain and West Wiltshire Downs were identified as a prime location for releasing hen harriers, as this area contains a large expanse of high quality semi-natural grassland amongst arable habitats, a landscape that provides the birds with suitable roosting sites and an abundance of prey. It also has consistently good numbers of wintering hen harriers, which could be important for future genetics and behavioural interactions with released birds.",

You may have structured text in a certain way for good reason, with users in mind, or you and the tool do not agree on what a complex sentence is. \n\nSome of the formulas cause qualitative and quantitative concepts to collide.

Approving a tool\u2019s grammar suggestions doesn\u2019t fix the content, it improves the readability score and that\u2019s a different thing. Good content design uses many techniques and has many parameters that are not measured by readability scores. Aspects include front-loading, word order, bulleted lists, frequent heading breaks and clear hierarchies.\n\nOne role for readability tools in user-centred design is when you need to improve lots of pages or a whole website at once. Tools can process hundreds of pages, and identify and prioritise the ones with the most issues. These can then be improved manually, according to content design principles.

Trees and woodlands bring management costs not typically incorporated into farming operations. For example, a risk to Newhouse Farm\u2019s young agroforestry plot has been the local deer population. The cost of deer fencing the in-field strips is unfeasible, but they are hoping enough trees survive to maturity. Managing diseased or dangerous trees also requires professional help and external resources. No farm is entirely the same; integrating trees into silvoarable or agroforestry systems, or creating new woodland, depends greatly on the farm\u2019s capacity to take chances and make changes with a long-term perspective, and on the support available to do so. Both David and Andy have a genuine ambition to integrate trees and habitats across their farm, produce food sustainably, and share their experiences with others. Thank you to them both for sharing their knowledge and experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
