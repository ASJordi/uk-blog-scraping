And this was, you know, quite a surprising piece of information for the world back at the time. And we put out information based upon the best estimates available at the time, which actually did subsequently be in the right ballpark as the IPCC, later on, started to delve into this, we reckoned about a fifth of CO2 emissions going into the atmosphere globally was down to the destruction of the tropical rainforests, and that proportion has gone down, not because the deforestation rate has dropped, but because industrial emissions have gone up, thereby making that proportion a bit smaller.",

And not only is that being deforested, it's being set on fire in order to open up the landscape for palm oil plantations. And then you get into discussions with policy makers, and - much less these days - but in the 1990s \u201cdon't worry about that\u201d people would say, \u201cbecause we're going to plant palm oil and eucalyptus for pulp plantations, and that will catch carbon, and therefore we've got a neutral contribution to CO2 to the atmosphere\u201d. This happened to be complete rubbish, of course, and the kind of information we have seen today helps underline the difference between an Acacia tree that's being grown for paper, compared to these immense, 150-foot tall Dipterocarpus trees that were being cut down to make way for those plantations.",

I do remember one negotiation, really important negotiations at Kyoto in December \u201897 COP 3 - led to the Kyoto Protocol - when you just get a sense of how much this discussion was in its infancy then, when governments were quite seriously suggesting that we should have a mechanism to count plantations in terms of their carbon benefit, but no comparable mechanism to count the dis-benefits coming from deforestation, creating a completely unbalanced picture of how these things pan out in the real world, in terms of how we might establish carbon sinks to solve the problem, without actually looking at the wider picture in terms of the sinks being simultaneously destroyed.",

And you get glimpses of this every now and again when a hurricane or a cyclone hits a coast, and you see the damage done in areas where the mangroves have been cleared compared to where they're still intact, a very big difference in terms of the cushioning effect. And though you see defences, of course, unlike concrete and steel, they are self-adjusting. They track sediments in those tangled roots. So as the sea goes up, so does the level of the base of the mangrove, which also is catching vast quantities of carbon, much more than a terrestrial tropical forest, at the same time as being a nursery for oceanic fish, which are of huge economic importance, layers of ecosystem service on top of one another in a system which is helping us to adapt from climate change, at the same time as catching a lot of carbon, so there's a lot going on in this space. It has become more sophisticated as we've gone along, and today is, I think, a really important landmark in understanding some of the interactions between this carbon and Nature story in a country like England.",

It was about development and urban sprawl. Nobody was really planning for agriculture or the forestry or the Nature, not in a systematic, national way. And they certainly weren't planning for carbon or climate change adaptation, but now we can hopefully embark on the journey that takes us into that space, and can begin to give us the opportunities to bring genuinely joined up integrated solutions to the many challenges that we face, and they are many, not only the Nature and climate crises, but we need to feed ourselves, we need to renew some of our infrastructure, and we need to build a lot more houses. All of these things are on the table at once, and blending in all of your work into that is a critically important job, and that framework could give us a means of doing it at the same time, it's giving us a spatial template to be able to deploy in a more efficient and targeted way, things like the environmental payments coming from the new farming policy, plus also how we might be able to deploy Nature recovery through biodiversity net gain and the better use of the protected area network that we've got, never mind what we might be doing to improve the quality of our rivers, all these things, in the end, connect.",

I started my first placement with International Nuclear Services (INS), which was a great opportunity for me to get into the role and learn more about the nuclear sector itself and cyber security.I had the opportunity to be placed within different subsidiaries within the NDA group. During my first placement, I had many great opportunities, not only learning more about the industry and the profession within the workplace, but also having the opportunity to build my confidence and further develop my personal attributes by being invited and attending the Cyber Security Connect Conference in Monaco and the International Conference on Nuclear Security at IEAE Vienna. These opportunities, along with others such as being part of Women in Nuclear and several other events which I have attended, have all helped me develop my networking skills, enabled me to meet some very interesting people from around the world and ultimately further develop my knowledge in the nuclear industry and cyber security.Cyber security was not something I had ever considered as I thought that this apprenticeship was about \u2018hacking\u2019 and, being honest, I wouldn\u2019t be good enough in terms of technical ability. However, after researching the apprenticeship I thought I would give it ago as this seemed to fit in well for me, having studied IT at A-level and I welcomed the fact that the apprenticeship was in the nuclear sector which was an aspiration of mine to work in.I think when looking into nuclear apprenticeship opportunities, people may think predominantly about engineering and science, however there is so much more now offered to young people just leaving school.I did, stereotypically, think cyber security wouldn\u2019t be for me. However, I soon found out that how wide of a field cyber security really is; there are so many areas to explore such as risk, security awareness, physical security elements, policy and procedure work and, of course, all of the technical work.I think apprenticeship schemes give everyone a chance at taking up career opportunities they maybe wouldn\u2019t have considered. Apprenticeship schemes allow for on-the-job experience, earning whilst learning and bring so many opportunities to grow and develop.Going into this apprenticeship, I wasn\u2019t the most confident individual, but I wanted to take all of the opportunities possible which could provide me with the scope to personally and professionally develop. I believe, with the support of Energus, my placement line managers and colleagues, I managed to achieve this.After completing the apprenticeship end point assessment process, I applied for a role within NTS as Information Assurance Advisor, which is the role I currently hold.",
