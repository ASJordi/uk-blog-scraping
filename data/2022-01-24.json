Exercise in prison is vital for mood stability, as well as physical health, and residents continually ask for more exercise videos.

For workers, this will represent a further deterioration in working conditions; some will find their payments reduced. Clients \u2013 and the quality of care \u2013 will also be affected. The overall trend is likely to be that workers on sleep-ins are not paid the NMW, and that it is harder to attract workers to these shifts.

And while all sides agree on the need for clarity, we suspect there may be less agreement on what the actual solution should be.

The LPC\u2019s value is in using a social partnership model to find consensus among different parties. There is currently no consensus. Any further development in the approach to sleep-ins would need to be inextricably linked to wider plans for social care\u2019s funding arrangements, its provider base and its workforce. This suggests that the Government is better placed than the LPC to resolve the treatment of sleep-ins.\u00a0 Though of course, if Government does decide to act on sleep-ins, the LPC would be willing to assist where it can.",

An entitlement to the NMW for sleep-ins would not change the underlying issues faced by most care workers or address the fundamental problems the sector faces.

Students and teachers alike are unaware of the myriad of career opportunities across the Civil Service in digital and technology. Having attended a comprehensive school in a disadvantaged area of Lancashire, I am acutely aware of the lack of available information and knowledge on careers both in digital, and in the Civil Service more generally. If you had asked me in Year 11 where I saw myself in five years time - I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have said an Associate Delivery Manager within the MoJ! Reducing this knowledge gap is something I have been incredibly passionate about since starting my career, and a cause I have been excited to work on during my time with the MoJ.\u00a0",

It was great to be able to dispel these misconceptions and share with students the myriad of ways into a career in digital within government. As an employer, the MoJ and the Civil Service more widely have many schemes in place to support students into meaningful and rewarding digital careers, through clearly defined career paths and opportunities such as summer internships, work experience and mentoring.",

                "content": "\nThere are complexities in every country that need to be considered when classifications are designed for collecting and reporting data on ethnic groups. These include how to best classify and describe the different groups in a population.\n\nSometimes countries can use detailed lists of ethnic groups for data collection, such as the Cultural and Ethnic Group classification in Australia. But often a country will also want a relatively short list of ethnicities that:\n\n* captures the main groups, in terms of population composition and importance for policymaking\n\n* allows people to respond quickly to surveys or other data collections\n\n* is appropriate for some survey methods \u2013 for example, a paper survey might have limited space for ethnicity categories\n\nThis need for concise lists will lead to differences in classifications between countries. \n\nIn the US, the categories \u2018American Indian\u2019 and \u2018Alaska Native\u2019 are part of the minimum standard for maintaining, collecting, and presenting data on race and ethnicity for all federal reporting purposes. In nearly all other countries the population and importance of these groups will be negligible, and so concise lists of ethnicity categories in those countries would not usually include them. In the UK white classification, the subclassifications of white British and white Irish will be less relevant in many other countries.\n\nThe US also differs from the UK in recommending 2 separate questions as a minimum for all federal reporting purposes \u2013 a question on race with 5 categories, and another on ethnicity with 2 (\u201cHispanic or Latino\u201d and \u201cNot Hispanic or Latino\u201d). Such differences introduce further difficulties in comparing data.\n\nDifferences in classifications can also occur because some ethnicity categories used in some countries, such as Gypsy in the UK, might be regarded as very sensitive elsewhere. A different label might be used to capture people who identify in a similar way in other countries.\n\nThere are also differences in the ethnicity questions within the 4 countries of the UK. This is because of the requirements of the constituent countries, and can have implications for producing outputs for Great Britain and the United Kingdom.\n\nFinally, even when ethnic groups in different countries might seem broadly comparable, there might be differences that should always be described in analysis. \n\nFor example, both the UK and the US have a white category. In the US Census, the white group includes people who identify with one or more nationalities or ethnic groups originating in the Middle East or North Africa, including Egyptian, Iranian and Lebanese. However, in the 2011 England and Wales Census, people who said their ethnicity was Iranian were more likely to be in the Asian or other ethnic group. People born in the Middle East and North Africa were more likely found in the other Asian, Arab, or any other ethnic groups than in any of the four white groups used in the Census.",
