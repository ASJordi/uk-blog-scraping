My role primarily involves analysing samples taken of the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities in the river. Each species of macroinvertebrate has its own tolerances or sensitivities to water quality and other habitat conditions such as sediment and flow velocity. Through identifying the species present, and their abundance, we can learn about the water quality of the river. Finding a higher number of species intolerant of pollution is indicative of good river health. Macroinvertebrates also act as a valuable food source for other animals such as fish, thus more diverse macroinvertebrate communities drive higher overall biodiversity. We also survey the river habitat and any aquatic/semi-aquatic plants found in the river channel to gather more data on the river quality, in particular pressures relating to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication (the process by which a body of water becomes progressively enriched with mineral and nutrients).",

As well as full-body fish, we encounter many derivative products, like fins, oil, skin, and meat from a variety of species. High-accuracy identification can be obtained using DNA but due to the high-cost and high-large-frequency of trade in many provinces in Indonesia, visual identification is still the best method to monitor trade. However, visual identification is often based on personal judgments from practical experience. In 2020, Cefas through the\u00a0Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund project assisted the Indonesian Government to equip inspectors with shark and ray product identification training and the development of training modules. Through this training, I learnt the science behind the identification process - how to observe, collect, and analyse the key distinguishing features of the species in the form of derivative products. First and foremost, we have to understand external morphology and the terminology for the full body, so that whenever we encounter unfamiliar characteristics in the products, we can use references that have been available to figure out from what species the product is made. The sustainability of shark and ray species depends on accurate identification as it is this data that will provide the basis for determining shark and ray management policies to realise sustainable use.\u201d",

There are a number of challenges that threaten the sustainability of the aquaculture sector. A major issue that has hampered the development of the sector in Nigeria is the lack of information about the prevention, treatment, and control of fish infections which is further complicated by the lack of a diagnostic lab for fish diseases. During the course of my training, I carried out a gap analysis of the situation of Antimicrobial Use (AMU) and AMR in aquaculture in my home country. Several gaps were identified, and a work plan was developed based on the analysis. Through this training, it has helped to strengthen my capacity on Quality Management Systems, quality of AMR diagnostics, data interpretation and advanced methods in surveillance of AMU and\u00a0 AMR. I was also allowed to explore my AMR curiosity with guidance enabling me to contribute in my own way to the scientific body of knowledge.

This training provided me with practical knowledge on the treatment of tissue samples, histopathology and in-situ hybridization for disease detection in aquatic animals.\u00a0 It was a great opportunity for me as a novice researcher to meet many female scientists and researchers at Cefas. Currently, I'm working to improve the BAU laboratory facilities with the assistance of my fellow co-workers, as our lab infrastructure is not that advanced and I am also encouraging female students to pursue research careers. Indeed, Bangladesh offers a wide range of opportunities for scientific and fieldwork employment. Yet, due to several societal constraints and environmental issues, it can be rather challenging for women to operate at the fieldwork level. Despite that fact, there are more and more motivated female students. We are now working with a fresh sense of optimism to support female students and incorporate them in aquaculture research for the overall advancement of our nation.\u201d",

The UN theme for International Women\u2019s Day 2023 #EmbraceEquity reminds us to consider if there is more work needed to ensure that the outdoors is welcoming to all women. Whilst women in England have equal rights to get outdoors, something which is not the case worldwide, there are other barriers such as not feeling safe in some places, or at some times of the day, or a lack of facilities for activities that women and girls want to do.
