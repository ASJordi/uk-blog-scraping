In addition, practical PPFL systems often need to work with heterogeneous clients that have different data and computational abilities. The UK-US Prize Challenges were designed to not only test whether solutions offered a strong level of privacy, but also to establish whether they could achieve performance that was practical in real world applications at scale. We asked some of the winners about the scalability challenges that they had to address, and about how the way data is distributed impacts the solutions.\u00a0",

Solutions based on cryptography, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation and Homomorphic Encryption, do work for arbitrary partitions but incur significant computational costs.

These plans are a positive step forward as, upon implementation, they should improve resilience to extreme droughts, serve a thriving economy and improve the environment allowing fish and wildlife to flourish.

The industry needs to ensure the reductions continue and are sustained under drier and more challenging conditions. There is a wide range of existing and emerging innovative ways water companies can reduce leakage. This includes activities such as pipe replacements, smart metering and smart monitoring of networks, and specific activities to help locate and fix leaks such as the use of acoustic logging, satellite imagery, drones and sniffer dogs that can pinpoint leaks.",

Not only is reducing demand important for the long-term management of water, but it is also hugely beneficial to society; it means less water being taken from the environment, less water and wastewater being pumped and treated, and reduces the need for new supplies to meet growth. This translates into fewer carbon emissions, lower costs and a healthier more sustainable environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
