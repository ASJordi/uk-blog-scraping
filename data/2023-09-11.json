The whole time the weir has existed it has significantly disrupted all natural river processes, with sediments trapped upstream and no opportunity for the natural migration of fish and other aquatic organisms.\u00a0 It\u2019s fair to say that back in 1852 there just wasn\u2019t the understanding we have now of how environmentally damaging these structures could be!

This included restoring and rehabilitating 55 acres of neglected land adjacent to the weir. This enabled us to access match funding through European Regional Development Funds to create a project that not only enhanced wildlife but also engaged local communities.

The commitment to tailored employment support \u2013 alongside ensuring that claimants of New Style benefits can access all of the employment programmes available to those receiving Universal Credit by default \u2013 is also very welcome.

We also remain convinced that many would benefit from all those applying for Universal Credit having their eligibility for New Style benefits automatically assessed.

Countering this the Government has said that full integration might inadvertently open up Universal Credit eligibility to those who have moved abroad. If this possibility cannot be removed \u2013 and we recognise this might require international agreement \u2013 then we urge the Government to continue to look for ways to combine the operation of the separate systems that, while short of full integration, could deliver many of the improvements that we are striving for.",
