Looking back, I\u2019m still not sure how I did it. But beyond the academic title and feeling of pride, the ultimate result was the learning of how to do research. I had become a professional researcher. However, this process had involved following specific practices constrained by rigid expectations to produce work destined for an academic context. Nevertheless, I began the expected journey of a new academic by undertaking a fellowship, conducting research, and producing papers.

On joining the Find Apprenticeship Training team I was introduced to the product owner, delivery manager, business analyst, UX designer, content writer, testers and developers. Pretty dizzying for someone who had the idea of siloed working ingrained into them. Despite it appearing that these different backgrounds had been thrown together at random, I quickly understood I had joined a well-oiled machine where communication, collaboration and transparency were key. I found this was especially important as I took my place as part of the design cycle working closely with the team\u2019s UX designer and content writer.

Schools should receive the recognition they deserve for the work they do with their pupils throughout the whole of primary school, in particular for those where the intake has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

For children, the assessment will be short, interactive, practical and fun. There is absolutely no requirement to prepare a child for this assessment and schools should reassure parents about that \u2013 it\u2019s not delivered as a formal test. The activities are very simply designed, short and age-appropriate. The RBA takes a child along a dynamic pathway that will quickly ascertain if something is too challenging and will jump to the next section. The experience is usually really positive for the child \u2013 they\u2019ve had the opportunity to sit with their teacher and take part in some fun activities, unaware that the activities form part of an assessment, and going forward, their teacher has a better idea of how to design learning especially for them.",
