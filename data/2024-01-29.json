This can include seeking to keep the coastline more or less where it is by maintaining or upgrading sea defences. It can involve working with nature to realign the shoreline, through the creation of inter-tidal habitat, whilst still protecting communities as much as we can. And in a specific number of places, it may involve letting nature take its course where it may not be technically feasible to provide protection over the longer term in the face of a changing climate. In such cases, we recognise this will require public bodies to be proactive in their engagement with communities and to actively empower local people to jointly develop options for coastal transition.",
