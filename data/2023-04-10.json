This is one of the reasons that CCS has partnered with APS Group and YPO to develop the Print marketplace, offering an online solution that makes it easier for print buyers to make more environmentally friendly buying decisions. This can be done in many ways. You can choose a specific grade of sustainability for your paper \u2013 right up to 100% recycled. The system doesn\u2019t have a minimum order quantity so the potential for wastage is significantly reduced. You can filter quotes based on delivery miles, meaning the closer your supplier, the less CO2 will be released into the atmosphere through transportation. The Print marketplace also supports your local economy, letting you choose a supplier based on locality. In addition to all this, 94% of our suppliers are SMEs, with over 300 apprentices employed across the supply chain.",

With the help of Climate Impact Partners, specialist in carbon market solutions for climate action, customers who choose to offset their emissions provide finance to projects which are reducing emissions now, supporting the transition to a low carbon global economy.",
