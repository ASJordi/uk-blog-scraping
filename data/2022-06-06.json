We heard from Patrick during his keynote address just how important it is to be a diverse and inclusive profession: the wider the range of backgrounds, characteristics and lived experiences, the less likely we are to succumb to group-think and the more likely we are to be innovative and achieve great outcomes in our work. This was reinforced during the Diversity and Inclusion session, where members of the GSE Diversity and Inclusion Action Group shared their thoughts on some of the challenges, discussed best practice and highlighted some of the progress that\u2019s been made. My main takeaway from this session was the importance of leaders being visible and open about our real selves \u2013 for me, that means remembering more than ever to be clear about being a proud British Bangladeshi, a muslim, and someone who deals with imposter syndrome.\u201d ",

If I was to narrow it down to two it would be the Turbo Talks from the morning session, which gave the opportunity for various individuals from across Government to present on their previously submitted S&E posters; Unfortunately I was unable to attend this session, but heard extremely positive reviews from the wide range of DfT colleagues that attended the conference. Furthermore, I was delighted to hear that Michaela Nelson from our very own team was one of these talks, spotlighting the DfT Futures Uncertainty Portal. The other was the strong emphasis throughout many of the session on Diversity and Inclusion and the importance of this within the Science and Engineering profession. It is great to see this at the forefront of our thinking and the great discussion both within the sessions and in the coffee/lunch breaks. ",

It was great to meet face to face for the first time, meet new members and have a session committed to embedding diversity and inclusion at the heart of everything we do. There is still work to do across GSE and we are always keen to welcome anyone interested in helping. We had so many questions from the audience we ran out of time.

Climate change is already impacting our cities and their residents, through heat and flooding, with associated actions to reduce climate change also improving air quality and the health or residents. The highest risks are felt in areas where the majority of the population are from an ethnic minority. The UK has one of the largest rates of public concern around climate change, but this concern has not been translated into large-scale action. The emphasis on devolved ownership of solutions to the local communities came across strongly in the discussion, with examples of where this has worked well. Policies need to actively support those working at the community level, rather than introducing extra process. Understanding the social context of the challenge, and how to communicate effectively with the community, is important right from the start of any intervention. People are an inherent part of our net zero journey and scientific co-development to generate behaviour change and initiate action is every much a part of the solution as policy changes.\u201c",

The amount of marine development is likely to increase significantly in the coming years, particularly in relation to offshore wind and the wider British Energy Security Strategy.

                "content": "The fascinating thing about beavers is their capacity to engineer the riparian woodland and wetland habitats around them. Research from both the ROBT and more widely has demonstrated that foraging behaviour on woody vegetation alters the vegetation structure, opening up parts of the canopy and increasing the diversity of habitats for plants, birds, bats and a range of other terrestrial species. Beaver activity can also increase the abundance of standing and submerged dead wood which is increasingly recognised as being critically important for a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic species. A recent investigation into all the evidence on the ecological impacts of beavers has noted that, whilst there are some priority woodland habitats where beaver activity would need careful consideration, the benefits to biodiversity are overwhelmingly positive. Research continues in Devon and more widely in the UK, and we are getting increasing requests from researchers for access to beaver sites to conduct ecological investigations for several different species groups. In addition to research being conducted on the River Otter, Devon Wildlife Trust has been monitoring the ecological changes at our West Devon Beaver Enclosure Project for the past 11 years. A recent publication provides an intriguing update into the changes in vegetation, invertebrates, amphibians, birds and bats.",

It is a priority for Devon Wildlife Trust to support farmers and landowners with the management of beaver activity. Currently this involves providing guidance and information, practical management of dams and the protection of important trees. Further information can be found in the Beaver Management Strategy Framework developed as part of the ROBT. One way to reduce or even eliminate these beaver-human conflicts is to make space for watercourses and wetlands by creating riparian buffer strips. As most of the challenges arise within 10-20m of water, in many places the size of these riparian buffers would be relatively modest. These riparian buffer strips allow space for natural processes to take hold, provide a natural corridor through the landscape and allow wildlife to flourish.",

EWCO is something that the Devon Wildlife Trust are currently investigating to support landowners in our area to make space for water and beavers.

For example, over the past 10 years there has been a decrease in the overall number of certificates issued for regulated qualifications (other than GCSE, AS and A levels). Although this does not necessarily reflect the change in the number of students taking these qualifications, the drop from 8.1 million to 4.6 million in the certificates issued between 2012 and 2021 is substantial. Yet, when broken down by subject, the data reveals that there has been broad stability in the number of certificates in health, public services and care.

For example, the removal of qualifications like International GCSEs from the DfE\u2019s school performance tables has meant a shift toward GCSEs since 2017. Given that GCSEs are not included in this data, this has resulted in a decrease in the number of certificates issued for Vocational and other qualifications. On the other hand, the Post-16 Skills Plan aimed at creating a high-quality Technical Education route may explain the increase in uptake of Level 3 qualifications. Other changes, such as the introduction of new regulatory arrangements under the Regulated Qualification Framework (RQF) and the redesigns of the structure of some qualifications by awarding organisations, might have also influenced the number of certificates issued. Knowing the context is, therefore, key to understanding the data and what it tells us.

The impact can be seen in the data. Between April and June 2020, when the country was in full lockdown, the number of certificates issued was the lowest of the past 10 years. Yet, at this time, around 400,000 certificates were still awarded. This is clearly a much lower-than-usual volume of certificates. But together with the 3.8 million certificates awarded between April 2020 and March 2021, it also shows the resilience of the qualifications systems in the midst of the public health emergency. A result that would not have been possible without the incredible effort of teaching and assessment professionals, as well as students and their parents coping with schools, college and workplaces closures, the cancellation of exams and assessments being adapted.",
