FCDO Labs has worked with the Sanctions Team in 2020 and 2021 to produce a number of iterations of the UK Sanctions List in response to various user needs. The main users of the list are UK financial institutions, HM Treasury and Border Force. They need user-friendly data, optimised for automation, to screen for people, entities and ships who are designated under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act in order to impose sanctions such as asset-freezes, travel bans or other measures.

What these techniques all have in common is exploring the user perspective of the experience in order to align it with business and legal requirements. By building layer upon layer of evidence from user insight, Labs and the Sanctions Team have uncovered latent and unknown user needs and begun to build capacity for these user-centred approaches within the Sanctions Team. The impact for the Sanctions Team has been a much stronger, more transparent and collaborative relationship with key users and stakeholders with anticipated future impact being fewer clarification enquiries and fewer legal challenges as the list continues to evolve.",

There are some great examples of effective and innovative online teaching, and universities and colleges have been delivering a high-quality blended approach since before the pandemic. Maintaining the option of online teaching for those who are vulnerable or isolating is to be encouraged. However, face-to-face teaching should remain the norm and the pandemic and must not be used as an opportunity for cost saving or for convenience.

You should rightly expect high-quality teaching, including the face-to-face education you were promised, and universities and colleges must listen to students when making changes to the way courses are delivered. You should be in no doubt that you deserve a fair deal and should understand what options are available if you feel you have not received what you were promised by your HE provider. As I know many universities and colleges are doing, it is important that they continue to support you, both to ensure you\u00a0are able to\u00a0engage with teaching and learning, and to ensure you have access to welfare and mental health support.",
