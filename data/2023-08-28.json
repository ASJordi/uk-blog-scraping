This shift has allowed ONS to look at more efficient ways of delivering the same outcome using cloud services. However, this has created a need to keep on top of costs and commitments, which is where FinOps (Financial Operations) comes in.

We are also working closely with the architecture teams on a \u2018tagging\u2019 strategy that will allow us to map and observe how the organisation is using cloud services, enabling us to advise and steer teams in optimum use of cloud.

We refer to this publication as a \u201cDisclosure\u201d.

Our intention is to use this power in response to moderately severe breaches, when an administrative warning letter would be too lenient on the facts of the case, but a civil monetary penalty would be disproportionately punitive. This is an important step in allowing OFSI to further tailor its enforcement action according to the different severities of breaches it sees. Through publishing details of breaches, this new enforcement tool will act as a form of censure and deterrent while also enabling compliance lessons to be available to other companies and individuals.\u00a0",

The company\u2019s policy at the time of the breach (of not restricting debit cards where a possible name match to a designated person was identified) was inappropriate for managing sanctions risk. A lack of resource at weekends to review sanctions alerts also led to a material delay in the proper restrictions being placed on a designated person\u2019s debit card. This case demonstrates that firms should carefully consider what resourcing is appropriate to manage sanctions risk exposure. When a firm identifies a sanctions risk, it should take steps to fully address that risk by promptly restricting all forms of access to funds or economic resources. Firms should also maintain proportionate sanctions screening and alert review functions whenever business is being conducted.\u00a0",

Although in this first disclosure case we determined that full use of the power to name the firm involved was proportionate to the breach, OFSI can also use its disclosure power for breaches of lesser severity to publish details of case where there is a useful compliance lesson to industry.
