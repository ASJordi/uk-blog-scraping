So we've got, you know, over sort of circa 2,000 people there using Jira in a sort of classic Kanban or Agile sprint type way of controlling and managing their works in terms of tasks and that comes with all the classic, you know, use of epics and stories and tasks behind it.

So it was really important that you know, that team had only got the sort of typical Jira Confluence administration skills, so they didn't have any skills around infrastructure support. So that was another key reason that we needed to move to cloud first in order to transition to another support team. And the cloud SaaS Jira Confluence service, really gives us some real improvements around new features, security performance, and really the sort of availability as well, because the service that we were supporting previously, was somewhat troublesome and had not really had much love past 18 months to sort of make sure that the service was always available to our user community. So quite a diverse range of reasons for moving to the platform. But fundamentally, this is a step forward really for this particular tool in in DWP.",

So it was a bit of a risk involved in this, a kind of calculated risk. What what we really wanted to build the team dynamic and test the team dynamic and see how strong that is. How does that develop? How quickly does it develop? And the only way to do that for as far as we could see was to dial back the micromanagement side of things and just see how much of that we really need if we've got a strong team. And that came together pretty quickly. It was pretty easy to do that and the size of the team is quite important in there. You can't really do this with a team of more than 12.

We were starting to see that the feeling of everyone in the team was starting to gel in terms of where we wanted to go, how realistic our estimates were, how quickly we could get things done. All these things started to sort of level out. So it was a very interesting thing to witness to actually watch that team begin to build.

We had a range of things we wanted to cover, but we didn't we didn't follow a kind of timed agenda or anything like that. What we found was that that that meeting tended to last less than an hour. We stuck to that. I think it was Tuesday afternoon, we stuck to that religiously for the whole project. And that gave us a good chance to kind of both reflect on where we\u2019d come to in the project and also do a little bit of micro planning for the week ahead up to the next checkpoint. And the third thing we did was we separated our risks issues, assumptions work, with those kind of analysis sessions that teams have, we separated that out into a separate session, which we called risk mitigation. So that that was particularly helpful, because it meant that we could just focus on risk mitigation. And it didn't take very long I think typically it took about 10 minutes a week to do that. And these sessions were quite valuable because they allowed us to make that a bit of a team sport. Just thinking back to what Ramona said, making these these activities more of a team game is very important. And we certainly did that with our treatment of risks and issues and assumptions and whatnot and we kept a good handle on those for the for the life of the project. It was good.",

That was the pinnacle test for us in proving that this thing worked end to end, and doing all the checks and balances on the data, to make sure that we hadn't lost anything, that all the users have been migrated, all of the Jira projects had migrated, and all the Confluence spaces had been migrated.

So in terms of, you know, economy of effort, we did a pretty good job on the project, we didn't waste a lot of time. But that said, I would say probably 40% of the total project time we built in as contingency, partly because the platform that we were migrating from had not been loved. So we weren't sure about what the consequences of that might be during a migration. And we also had quite a large volume of users as well. We didn't want to lose any of their data.

We had all kinds of questions coming in whilst Linda was presenting and we were able to answer those in real time.

And it was recognised by the user community that we had gone the extra mile to make sure that they were fully informed about what we did and also that they had the opportunity to engage with the whole team, so it I guess it comes back to that sort of flatter hierarchical, getting rid of some of those hierarchies so we didn't push people into our front door or anything like that.

But I think the thing that really struck me was on our internal Tuesday call, our internal team call, where it was a bit like tumbleweed because we hadn't really got very much to talk about because the migration had just gone really very much to plan. Not better than expected, because we were expecting it to go well, but it just went so smoothly that there wasn't really anything to pick up in that week. We got to that Tuesday call and the call lasted about 10 minutes, because we didn't really have an awful lot to say other than well done everybody, we've actually done this, you know, we've pulled this off. So to me that that was a great sign that the team had had kind of come through on this. And it was really down to that team dynamic.

So it was a great case study for us for how to build that trust as well. Just going back to Ramona\u2019s comment about, having this more honest relationship, this no BS kind of relationship. I think that was a really important reason why this project worked. Because Atlassian are that kind of company, that they have that kind of ethos, I think that was something I hadn't appreciated until we hit some interesting talking points partway through the project, we were having heated discussions about things.

But I would say, really focus on that on that team dynamic, be as open as possible. The other groups that you involve in the project, try to adopt them into your team if you can. We did that with the new service support team, we involved them in quite early on in the project and opened everything up to them. We also did that with the test and release team, we were super helpful throughout the project, and they really helped us to build a lot of confidence in what we were doing.

And that gave us a big confidence boost when they came back and said the preparations looked pretty solid. And they gave us a few little nuggets of things to help us to put the final pieces in place.

Founded in 2014, this social enterprise bakery was envisioned after the founding members came into contact with women who were experiencing multiple disadvantages, and the lack of opportunities were perpetuating cycles of poverty. Bringing together their skill sets and passion, the founding members began to offer baking classes to the women they were meeting, and through that, support and community grew. After what started in the kitchen of an East London church, Luminary has grown into what it is today - two cafe and bakery locations across London (Camden & Stoke Newington) and a training centre. As of summer 2021,\u00a0 107 women have enrolled in the Employability and Independence Programme.",

Therefore, providing a safe space and a sense of community is an essential part of Luminary\u2019s work as they train and support each cohort.",

Some have gone on to start their own businesses and work in other bakeries across the city, while others have apprenticed in Luminary\u2019s very own bakeries and have joined their staff. The overall opportunities are vast and expand as each woman is empowered and, therefore, empowers others through this resilient community.",
