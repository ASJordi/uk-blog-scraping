And we know that the kind of pornography accessed may be violent and degrading, with long-lasting effects on expectations of relationships and sex. So the case for addressing porn in the classroom has never been more persuasive or pressing. But how do we approach this tricky and potentially embarrassing topic through PSHE education?",

It needs to be embedded in wider learning about consent, relationship expectations and how these are influenced by different sources such as the media, peers and porn. Good teaching about the online world will also reduce chances of accidental access. It should however never be dealt with through assemblies or one-off sessions alone but effectively sequenced through regular lessons.",

It is also a helpful staff training exercise to map out and rehearse tricky questions and answers to avoid feeling \u2018on the spot\u2019 in lessons.\u00a0 Encourage anonymous questions in class as they allow pupils to ask what they might be afraid to in front of others.

This can be a delicate balancing act; we do not want to normalise porn viewing given there will be those in class who have never seen it. We also cannot be ambivalent or positive in our messaging around porn given the research is too clear on the harms it can do. But, we also don\u2019t want to shame those who have seen it, as this is likely to alienate members of the class. Instead, we should provide a better understanding of the way in which online pornography is pushed by the industry, including the way in which algorithms graduate towards harder content \u2013 so-called \u2018dark nudges\u2019.",
