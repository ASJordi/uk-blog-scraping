The first tranche covers over 120,000 hectares - almost the same area as England\u2019s 221 NNRs - and these multi-partnership projects are creating and restoring wildlife-rich habitats, corridors and stepping-stones which will help wildlife populations to move and thrive across town and countryside alike.",

Our calculations showed that even a small difference in the price per litre could have sizeable aggregate impacts on UK consumers: a 1p/litre change would be equivalent to around \u00a3120 million across all cars.
