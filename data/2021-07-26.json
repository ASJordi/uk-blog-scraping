It grows alongside knowledge, skills and experience; like an unquantified superpower (analogous to the infamous \u201cright-stuff\u201d so prized by the early US space programme). We recognise that, as the Army transforms, we will need to share data with increasing impunity, but with the ever-expanding number of sources feeding us with bigger, faster and novel data sets, we cannot continue to expect commanders to use their intuition to recognise the hidden patterns and critical nuggets within the data. Resolving this will have to become the domain of machines and algorithms; being comfortable with this paradigm change will require a fundamental shift in our culture.",

We\u2019ve experimented with apprenticeships in the DevSecOps world, but ultimately many leave us for better paid roles. The result is we are currently dominated by 'As A Service' contracts, but is that the right model? What are other organisations doing to address this challenge?

So that's what we're trying to do and it's a good example of where we're providing a reusable service.

So we actually had five data centres in the old, old days where we used to provide all our benefit processing systems. Then in the late 90s, we moved from an in-house to an outsourced supplier. So actually that was service was provided to us, by initially, EDS, and then it was Hewlett Packard. So it was definitely an outsourced model.

Moving into the cloud, which I do have some experience of, for me is mind blowing. It's actually a quantum leap and the power and the flexibility and the cost efficiencies and the speed of delivery, is actually quite staggering, and it is actually changing the delivery of IT and underpinning a lot of what is actually going on in the in the IT sector in general.

So a lot of that is given to you and my trick as the lead architect is making sure that we're using the right services, that we're getting the right information, monitoring the right things and then again, from a security perspective, making sure we're implementing the right security framework to make sure that our services are secure, but also so that people can access them in the appropriate ways.",

So that we can, you know, when we have quiet periods, we can ramp down our services and then when we actually have busy periods, we have lots of transactions, we can ramp up those services very quickly indeed. In the old days, when it was on premise hosting, we would have to put an infrastructure in place that what we would term should actually cope with the highest volume. So potentially, you know, we have a lot of kit, but that kit is not being used, but we still have to pay for is capital expenditure. With the cloud, we can ramp up and ramp down those services, depending on the volumes going it through a very quickly and that leads to a much more cost effective approach and that is significant for the for the department.",

That could take months to actually do, whereas something like using the cloud it\u2019s literally available on tap and again, I can't emphasise to me better my experience is mind blowing the power and the flexibility.
