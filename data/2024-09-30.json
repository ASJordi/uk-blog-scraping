The need for a good working relationship with neighbours and the challenges this brought wasn\u2019t something I was aware of before the visit. It was great to see the detail within a commons agreement, as well as location (how hilly or none hilly!). I hadn\u2019t realised as a non-farmer what an impact it would have. It was also very interesting to hear comments about the type of customer contact they have with RPA and improvements they want to see in that area, as well as the frustration that SFI isn\u2019t yet available to HLS customers. One piece of work I\u2019ll be able to feed into my day-to-day tasks will be how we can improve RPA\u2019s interactions with farmers and land managers by making better use of our data to enhance the customer experience.\u201d ",

The Office for Life Sciences (OLS) spurred a UK cancer vaccine initiative, partnering with BioNTech, Moderna, and MSD, and mobilising NHSE and NIHR. This created the Cancer Vaccine Launchpad and Vaccine Innovation Pathway, leading to expert groups within the MHRA. In 18 months, the UK became a global leader in cancer vaccine development, with over 500 patients in trials and investments from 12 manufacturers. By 2030, the UK aims to lead globally, with 10,000 patients in trials. The OLS Team\u2019s efforts have positioned the UK at the forefront of this technology.\u00a0",

We have made significant progress in pilot lab trials, achieving infertility in rats fed a contraceptive vaccine. This is (as far as we are aware) the first time any research group has managed to get a functional response from a contraceptive vaccine delivered in a voluntary bait.

By microchipping 202 squirrels in six woodlands trialled in different seasons, we demonstrated that male and female squirrels would take, on average, 40g of bait from feeders over most days of a four-day bait deployment.

In development is an automatic weighing platform that uses a minimum squirrel body weight to open a door. We have worked with volunteer groups across northern England and Wales to gather hundreds of red squirrel bodyweights, using automatic weighing scales attached to feeders. These data suggest that, by setting a weight higher than the heaviest of red squirrels, we could deliver a bait containing contraceptives to over 90% of adult grey squirrels while making sure no red squirrels access it.
