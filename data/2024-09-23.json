Improved data collection and increased monitoring are vital to enable scientists to better understand complex ecosystems and physical properties (e.g. temperature) in UK waters allowing for better identification of marine heatwaves and their impacts.\u00a0 Also, a more responsive, real-time monitoring system, which could be triggered as a marine heatwave occurs, could significantly enhance our understanding of future events.",

When Defra receives applications to consider new bathing water locations, the criteria cover elements like usage, access and the location of amenities like toilets. It does not initially include water quality as the sites will not have been previously sampled for bathing water quality. But once a bathing water does become designated, it will be managed and expected to reach water quality standards fit enough to swim in \u2013 which is not the case for other water bodies.\u00a0\u00a0",

Once enough samples have been taken this season, each site will be given a bathing water classification ranging from \u2018Excellent\u2019 to \u2018Poor\u2019 to help you decide where to go swimming. It can often take years to build an accurate picture of the factors that might be affecting the bathing water quality at a site. In the meantime, if you are river swimming, consider the length of the river upstream of a new site and all the possible sources of pollutions along it like water company discharges, agricultural runoff, even septic tanks.\u00a0\u00a0",

There is a lot of public interest to address concerns about water quality in these places and raise the bar from an ecological standard set to protect fish and wildlife up to a much higher level of quality needed for safe human use. Rivers have not been managed for recreation until recently. Rivers are usually monitored for their ecological health. However, this historic monitoring doesn\u2019t include measuring the bacteria that would indicate a possible risk to human health as the river wildlife is largely unaffected by these. The bacteria we measure for bathing water quality come from faeces, which in turn can be present in treated and untreated sewage effluent, runoff from livestock and farming or from private treatment systems like septic tanks.\u00a0 Bacteria and pathogens found in sewage and animal slurry pose the two biggest risks to human health. Because these factors do not typically affect wildlife, they haven\u2019t been subject to strict controls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

During the recent cost of living crisis, many charities have faced a triple threat from increased running costs, greater demand for their services and reducing income. Our recent research highlights a fall in the number of people saying they have donated or raised funds for charity, alongside a steep increase in the number of people who have received help from a charity. Meanwhile our most recently published analysis of annual returns to the Commission shows smaller charities experiencing reductions in income and a rise in expenditure.",

You can make it less stressful by being prepared for such an eventuality. That is why we have refreshed our guidance about improving your charity's finances (also known as CC12). In it, we explain that it is vital that all trustees, regardless of whether they have financial expertise, have a clear picture of their charity's finances, so that they can act on any 'early warning indicators'. Spotting problems early gives trustees a better range of options, which can help them manage the impact on their charity\u2019s beneficiaries and any employees and help them recover and avoid insolvency.",

By doing this, trustees can collectively take appropriate action to avoid financial difficulties or spot any difficulties early. Early identification of problems gives charities the best chance of recovery, by widening the range of options available to improve the situation and avoid short notice challenges or, ultimately, insolvency. The guidance lists some of these steps, such as launching a fundraising appeal or changing how your charity operates.",
