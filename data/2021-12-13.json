Similarly, our rating of wider impacts (81% compared to 70%) and monitoring and evaluation plans (90% compared to 60%) were higher for IAs that had had earlier RPC scrutiny.

This highlights the need for departments to be more conscientious in carrying PIRs out in order to inform decisions over whether regulations should be retained, revised or replaced.

I am delighted that so many have also offered additional support as we surge efforts to deliver the booster programme even more quickly than planned.

As we approach the winter holidays, take up of the booster jab is also critical for you and your staff and eligible students to protect everyone from serious illness and provide the best defence possible. 12 -15 year olds who have not been vaccinated can book an appointment out of school on the National Booking System, and from 20th December those eligible for second doses will be also be able to book.",

This was important for the session because part of creating change in large systems involves not only designing a concept, but also the process by which that concept can come into being.\u00a0",

We have previously written about using different sensory formats for policy discussions. For our workshops at Design for Planet, we were additionally inspired by \u2019craftivist\u2019, Sarah Corbett who uses crafted objects to contemplate global issues, provoke thought and start conversations. This approach influenced our deliberate slow repurposing of found artefacts. These included handmade policy canvases to help participants develop their ideas, and origami polar bears used for an icebreaker exercise, crafted from discarded buffet cart bags collected on our train journey to Dundee.",

The nature of domestic work means that they are hidden in private homes with limited support networks.
